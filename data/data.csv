0,0,Quality of the Healthcare Services During COVID-19 Pandemic in Selected European Countries,"Magdalena Tuczyńska, R. Staszewski, M. Matthews‑Kozanecka",Frontiers in Public Health,2022,"Background There are several definitions of the quality of healthcare services. It may be defined as a level of value provided by any health care resource, as determined by some measurement. Scientists use a variety of quality measures to attempt to determine health care quality. They use special indicators or based on a patients' or healthcare professional's perception. This article aims to provide a short review of the available data on the quality of healthcare services in selected European countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology The research was done by the use of online databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct. All the studies focused on the quality of healthcare services, yet the studies used different methods to measure this quality. In addition, the results of the authors' survey on the assessment of the quality of healthcare services before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were presented. Results Among twelve studies, four were from the United Kingdom and one each of Catalonia, Italy, Sweden, Poland, Netherlands, France, Germany, Belgium. Patients in the United Kingdom felt that the quality of services was good during the pandemic, whereas the quality declined in the other studies cited. The results of our research also revealed a decrease in the quality of healthcare services provided. Conclusions Nevertheless the development of telemedicine has had a positive impact on the quality of healthcare services. The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly affected most European countries' quality of healthcare services.",0.0
1,1,Data Quality in Health Care: Main Concepts and Assessment Methodologies,"M. Mashoufi, H. Ayatollahi, Davoud Khorasani-Zavareh",Methods of Information in Medicine,2022,"Abstract Introduction  In the health care environment, a huge volume of data is produced on a daily basis. However, the processes of collecting, storing, sharing, analyzing, and reporting health data usually face with numerous challenges that lead to producing incomplete, inaccurate, and untimely data. As a result, data quality issues have received more attention than before. Objective  The purpose of this article is to provide an insight into the data quality definitions, dimensions, and assessment methodologies. Methods  In this article, a scoping literature review approach was used to describe and summarize the main concepts related to data quality and data quality assessment methodologies. Search terms were selected to find the relevant articles published between January 1, 2012 and September 31, 2022. The retrieved articles were then reviewed and the results were reported narratively. Results  In total, 23 papers were included in the study. According to the results, data quality dimensions were various and different methodologies were used to assess them. Most studies used quantitative methods to measure data quality dimensions either in paper-based or computer-based medical records. Only two studies investigated respondents' opinions about data quality. Conclusion  In health care, high-quality data not only are important for patient care, but also are vital for improving quality of health care services and better decision making. Therefore, using technical and nontechnical solutions as well as constant assessment and supervision is suggested to improve data quality.",0.048668372489589745
2,2,Evaluating online health information quality using machine learning and deep learning: A systematic literature review,"Y. Baqraf, Pantea Keikhosrokiani, Manal Al-rawashdeh · Jan 1, 202",Digital Health,2023,"Background Due to the large volume of online health information, while quality remains dubious, understanding the usage of artificial intelligence to evaluate health information and surpass human-level performance is crucial. However, the existing studies still need a comprehensive review highlighting the vital machine, and Deep learning techniques for the automatic health information evaluation process. Objective Therefore, this study outlines the most recent developments and the current state of the art regarding evaluating the quality of online health information on web pages and specifies the direction of future research. Methods In this article, a systematic literature is conducted according to the PRISMA statement in eight online databases PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, ACM, Springer Link, Wiley Online Library, Emerald Insight, and Web of Science to identify all empirical studies that use machine and deep learning models for evaluating the online health information quality. Furthermore, the selected techniques are compared based on their characteristics, such as health quality criteria, quality measurement tools, algorithm type, and achieved performance. Results The included papers evaluate health information on web pages using over 100 quality criteria. The results show no universal quality dimensions used by health professionals and machine or deep learning practitioners while evaluating health information quality. In addition, the metrics used to assess the model performance are not the same as those used to evaluate human performance. Conclusions This systemic review offers a novel perspective in approaching the health information quality in web pages that can be used by machine and deep learning practitioners to tackle the problem more effectively.",0.0
3,3,Data Quality in Health Research: Integrative Literature Review,"F. Bernardi, Domingos Alves, N. Crepaldi",Journal of Medical Internet Research,2022,"Background Decision-making and strategies to improve service delivery must be supported by reliable health data to generate consistent evidence on health status. The data quality management process must ensure the reliability of collected data. Consequently, various methodologies to improve the quality of services are applied in the health field. At the same time, scientific research is constantly evolving to improve data quality through better reproducibility and empowerment of researchers and offers patient groups tools for secured data sharing and privacy compliance. Objective Through an integrative literature review, the aim of this work was to identify and evaluate digital health technology interventions designed to support the conducting of health research based on data quality. Methods A search was conducted in 6 electronic scientific databases in January 2022: PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Digital Library, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist and flowchart were used to visualize the search strategy results in the databases. Results After analyzing and extracting the outcomes of interest, 33 papers were included in the review. The studies covered the period of 2017-2021 and were conducted in 22 countries. Key findings revealed variability and a lack of consensus in assessing data quality domains and metrics. Data quality factors included the research environment, application time, and development steps. Strategies for improving data quality involved using business intelligence models, statistical analyses, data mining techniques, and qualitative approaches. Conclusions The main barriers to health data quality are technical, motivational, economical, political, legal, ethical, organizational, human resources, and methodological. The data quality process and techniques, from precollection to gathering, postcollection, and analysis, are critical for the final result of a study or the quality of processes and decision-making in a health care organization. The findings highlight the need for standardized practices and collaborative efforts to enhance data quality in health research. Finally, context guides decisions regarding data quality strategies and techniques. International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID) RR2-10.1101/2022.05.31.22275804",0.0
4,4,Digital health for quality healthcare: A systematic mapping of review studies,"M. Ibrahim, Harmy Mohamed Yusoff, Yasrul Izad Abu Bakar",Digital Health,2022,"Objective To systematically catalogue review studies on digital health to establish extent of evidence on quality healthcare and illuminate gaps for new understanding, perspectives and insights for evidence-informed policies and practices. Methods We systematically searched PubMed database using sensitive search strings. Two reviewers independently conducted two-phase selection via title and abstract, followed by full-text appraisal. Consensuses were derived for any discrepancies. A standardized data extraction tool was used for reliable data mining. Results A total of 54 reviews from year 2014 to 2021 were included with notable increase in trend of publications. Systematic reviews constituted the majority (61.1%, (37.0% with meta-analyses)) followed by scoping reviews (38.9%). Domains of quality being reviewed include effectiveness (75.9%), accessibility (33.3%), patient safety (31.5%), efficiency (25.9%), patient-centred care (20.4%) and equity (16.7%). Mobile apps and computer-based were the commonest (79.6%) modalities. Strategies for effective intervention via digital health included engineering improved health behaviour (50.0%), better clinical assessment (35.1%), treatment compliance (33.3%) and enhanced coordination of care (24.1%). Psychiatry was the discipline with the most topics being reviewed for digital health (20.3%). Conclusion Digital health reviews reported findings that were skewed towards improving the effectiveness of intervention via mHealth applications, and predominantly related to mental health and behavioural therapies. There were considerable gaps on review of evidence on digital health for cost efficiency, equitable healthcare and patient-centred care. Future empirical and review studies may investigate the association between fields of practice and tendency to adopt and research the use of digital health to improve care.",0.0
5,5,Analysis and evaluation of developed and used health scores.,"Daniel Kaiser, Adrian Schuhmacher, Justin Schmidtke",Health promotion international,2023,"This systematic review provides an overview of existing multidimensional health scores, including an assessment of their holistic value (coverage of all determinants and dimensions of health), and a systematic comparison of their properties. The review is based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Literature searches were conducted in English (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Sciences) and German databases (BISp-Surf, BIBNET). All scores that considered health multidimensional on an individual level were included. Two independent reviewers screened and identified articles. The Quality assessment tool for studies with diverse design was used to assess study quality. Scores were recorded in a criteria grid to make their properties comparable, and the multidimensionality of the individual scores was evaluated using radar chart visualizations. Twenty-six studies met the inclusion criteria. Study quality was strong in eight, fair in twelve, and weak in six studies. Among the 26 studies, 21 different questionnaire-based scores were included, which all covered at least three of the five health dimensions (Five dimensions have been identified in a former literature research). Three scores covered all dimensions, but none covered all of the previously defined determinants. Thus, according to this works created definition (holistic = cover all dimensions with all determinants), no holistic health score exists, only multidimensional scores covering different dimensions and determinants. This review offers good comparability, as all the instruments were questionnaires, and could be used as a basis for future research. A universal (holistic) health construct should be defined and developed to improve the quantification of health.",0.0
6,6,Digital Health Data Quality Issues: Systematic Review,"R. Syed, R. Eden, Tendai Makasi",Journal of Medical Internet Research,2023,"Background The promise of digital health is principally dependent on the ability to electronically capture data that can be analyzed to improve decision-making. However, the ability to effectively harness data has proven elusive, largely because of the quality of the data captured. Despite the importance of data quality (DQ), an agreed-upon DQ taxonomy evades literature. When consolidated frameworks are developed, the dimensions are often fragmented, without consideration of the interrelationships among the dimensions or their resultant impact. Objective The aim of this study was to develop a consolidated digital health DQ dimension and outcome (DQ-DO) framework to provide insights into 3 research questions: What are the dimensions of digital health DQ? How are the dimensions of digital health DQ related? and What are the impacts of digital health DQ? Methods Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, a developmental systematic literature review was conducted of peer-reviewed literature focusing on digital health DQ in predominately hospital settings. A total of 227 relevant articles were retrieved and inductively analyzed to identify digital health DQ dimensions and outcomes. The inductive analysis was performed through open coding, constant comparison, and card sorting with subject matter experts to identify digital health DQ dimensions and digital health DQ outcomes. Subsequently, a computer-assisted analysis was performed and verified by DQ experts to identify the interrelationships among the DQ dimensions and relationships between DQ dimensions and outcomes. The analysis resulted in the development of the DQ-DO framework. Results The digital health DQ-DO framework consists of 6 dimensions of DQ, namely accessibility, accuracy, completeness, consistency, contextual validity, and currency; interrelationships among the dimensions of digital health DQ, with consistency being the most influential dimension impacting all other digital health DQ dimensions; 5 digital health DQ outcomes, namely clinical, clinician, research-related, business process, and organizational outcomes; and relationships between the digital health DQ dimensions and DQ outcomes, with the consistency and accessibility dimensions impacting all DQ outcomes. Conclusions The DQ-DO framework developed in this study demonstrates the complexity of digital health DQ and the necessity for reducing digital health DQ issues. The framework further provides health care executives with holistic insights into DQ issues and resultant outcomes, which can help them prioritize which DQ-related problems to tackle first.",0.0
7,7,Impact of health system governance on healthcare quality in low-income and middle-income countries: a scoping review,"Joby George, Susan Jack, Robin Gauld",BMJ Open,2023,"Introduction Improving healthcare quality in low-/middle-income countries (LMICs) is a critical step in the pathway to Universal Health Coverage and health-related sustainable development goals. This study aimed to map the available evidence on the impacts of health system governance interventions on the quality of healthcare services in LMICs. Methods We conducted a scoping review of the literature. The search strategy used a combination of keywords and phrases relevant to health system governance, quality of healthcare and LMICs. Studies published in English until August 2023, with no start date limitation, were searched on PubMed, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar and ProQuest. Additional publications were identified by snowballing. The effects reported by the studies on processes of care and quality impacts were reviewed. Results The findings from 201 primary studies were grouped under (1) leadership, (2) system design, (3) accountability and transparency, (4) financing, (5) private sector partnerships, (6) information and monitoring; (7) participation and engagement and (8) regulation. Conclusions We identified a stronger evidence base linking improved quality of care with health financing, private sector partnerships and community participation and engagement strategies. The evidence related to leadership, system design, information and monitoring, and accountability and transparency is limited.",0.0

Moorthie, Vicky Peacey, Siân Evans",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2022,"Identifying and monitoring of health inequalities requires good-quality data. The aim of this work is to systematically review the evidence base on approaches taken within the healthcare context to improve the quality of data for the identification and monitoring of health inequalities and describe the evidence base on the effectiveness of such approaches or recommendations. Peer-reviewed scientific journal publications, as well as grey literature, were included in this review if they described approaches and/or made recommendations to improve data quality relating to the identification and monitoring of health inequalities. A thematic analysis was undertaken of included papers to identify themes, and a narrative synthesis approach was used to summarise findings. Fifty-seven papers were included describing a variety of approaches. These approaches were grouped under four themes: policy and legislation, wider actions that enable implementation of policies, data collection instruments and systems, and methodological approaches. Our findings indicate that a variety of mechanisms can be used to improve the quality of data on health inequalities at different stages (prior to, during, and after data collection). These findings can inform us of actions that can be taken by those working in local health and care services on approaches to improving the quality of data on health inequalities.",0.0

Green, Claire Quilliam, Lyndal Sheepway",BMJ Open,2022,"Objectives To explore and synthesise the evidence relating to features of quality in rural health student placements. Design Scoping review. Data sources MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, ProQuest, Informit, Scopus, ERIC and several grey literature data sources (1 January 2005 to 13 October 2020). Study selection The review included peer-reviewed and grey literature from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development listed countries that focused on quality of health student placements in regional, rural and remote areas. Data extraction Data were extracted regarding the methodological and design characteristics of each data source, and the features suggested to contribute to student placement quality under five categories based on a work-integrated learning framework. Results Of 2866 resulting papers, 101 were included for data charting and content analysis. The literature was dominated by medicine and nursing student placement research. No literature explicitly defined quality in rural health student placements, although proxy indicators for quality such as satisfaction, positive experiences, overall effectiveness and perceived value were identified. Content analysis resulted in four overarching domains pertaining to features of rural health student placement quality: (1) learning and teaching in a rural context, (2) rural student placement characteristics, (3) key relationships and (4) required infrastructure. Conclusion The findings suggest that quality in rural health student placements hinges on contextually specific features. Further research is required to explore these findings and ways in which these features can be measured during rural health student placements.",0.0
10,10,What problems in health care quality should we target as the world burns around us?,"Kaveh G. Shojania · Feb 27, 202",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association Journal,2022,"© 2022 CMA Impact Inc. or its licensors CMAJ | February 28, 2022 | Volume 194 | Issue 8 E311 I n 2001, an influential report defined quality health care in terms of 6 domains: safety, effectiveness, timeliness, efficiency, patient-centredness and equity.1 Physicians primarily focus on effectiveness, which can be defined operationally as the degree to which patients receive the recommendations from practice guidelines relevant to their care. Only about 50% of patients receive such recommended care.2 In addition, patients frequently receive nonrecommended care and undergo tests and treatments with no clear benefits.3 In related research, Squires and colleagues provide contemporary estimates of these twin problems of underuse and overuse in Canada.4 Using Canadian data from 174 studies published from 2007 to 2021, they found a median proportion of inappropriate care (either underuse or overuse) of 30%. This inventory of shortfalls in the delivery of effective care comes after decades of efforts to address such quality problems,5 begging the question, “What should we be doing to deliver better quality care?” The mainstream approach to quality improvement — my professional focus for many years — aims to ensure that tests and treatments with established benefits are offered routinely to patients. Yet, efforts to promote the uptake of recommended care have produced few substantive successes. A systematic review of more than 100 interventions to improve professional practice that was published in CMAJ in 1995 concluded that “we have no magic bullets — most interventions achieved small to modest improvements in recommended practices.”6 More than 25 years later, promoting the uptake of effective interventions or de-implementing ineffective ones remains difficult. For instance, 2 common improvement interventions, computerized decision support and performance report cards, typically increase the proportion of patients receiving recommended care by just 5% overall according to the findings of 2 metaanalyses.7,8 Although some individual trials report larger improvements, the circumstances producing such results remain unclear. Even if worthwhile improvements could be generated consistently, overloading physicians with report cards and reminders for multiple different quality targets is unsustainable. The authors of the related systematic review4 identified glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) testing as the most frequently underused diagnostic test in Canada. Addressing underuse of HbA1c testing might prompt use of the many effective therapies for diabetes that have become available in recent years. Yet, more than 100 randomized controlled trials evaluating improvement interventions for outpatients with diabetes achieved an average reduction in HbA1c of just 0.37%.9 Although future research might identify more effective improvements, the question then becomes how to decide which quality problems to prioritize. This prioritization might depend on the anticipated health benefits from closing any particular shortfall in recommended care. Statins, the most frequent therapeutic example of underuse in the systematic review,4 provides a telling example. Among patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 33–100 must take a statin for 10 years to prevent 1 cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke or recurrent ischemic event.10 In addition, use of statins postpones death in patients with established atherosclerotic disease by just 17 days.11 Of course, clinical interventions with larger benefits exist — vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, for example — but they represent the Commentary Health services",0.0
11,11,Towards a harmonised framework for developing quality of care indicators for global health: a scoping review of existing conceptual and methodological practices,"L. Dudley, Punithasvaree Mamdoo, Selvan Naidoo",BMJ Health & Care Informatics,2022,"Objectives Despite significant advances in the science of quality of care measurement over the last decade, approaches to developing quality of care indicators for global health priorities are not clearly defined. We conducted a scoping review of concepts and methods used to develop quality of healthcare indicators to better inform ongoing efforts towards a more harmonised approach to quality of care indicator development in global health. Methods We conducted a systematic search of electronic databases, grey literature and references for articles on developing quality of care indicators for routine monitoring in all healthcare settings and populations, published in English between 2010 and 2020. We used well-established methods for article screening and selection, data extraction and management. Results were summarised using a descriptive analysis and a narrative synthesis. Results The 221 selected articles were largely from high-income settings (89%), particularly the USA (46%), Canada (9%), UK (9%) and Europe (17%). Quality of care indicators were developed mainly for healthcare providers (56%), for benchmarking or quality assurance (37%) and quality improvement (29%), in hospitals (32%) and primary care (26%), across many diseases. The terms ‘quality indicator’ and ‘quality measure’ were the most frequently encountered terms (50% and 21%, respectively). Systematic approaches for quality of care indicator development emerged within national quality of care systems or through cross-country collaborations in high-income settings. Maternal, neonatal and child health (33%), mental health (26%) and primary care (57%) studies applied most components of systematic approaches, but not consistently or rigorously. Discussion The current evidence shows variations in concepts and approaches to developing quality of care indicators, with development and application mainly in high-income countries. Conclusion Additional efforts are needed to propose ‘best-practice’ conceptual frameworks and methods for developing quality of care indicators to improve their utility in global health measurement.",0.0
12,12,Oral health and oral health-related quality of life among older adults receiving home health care services: A scoping review.,"S. H. Henni, R. Skudutyte-Rysstad, V. Ansteinsson",Gerodontology,2022,"OBJECTIVE
To map the literature on subjective and objective oral health indicators and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in older adults receiving home health care services (HHCS).


BACKGROUND
The proportion of older adults in need of HHCS will increase in the coming years. Previous studies indicate that frail and dependent older adults are at increased risk for oral diseases, due to challenges with daily oral hygiene and regular access to dental services.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Four databases were searched in November 2020 for relevant literature. Search terms included a comprehensive list of terms for adults 65 years or older receiving HHCS, clinical and subjective oral health indicators, and OHRQoL. The literature was reviewed based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.


RESULTS
Of the 3114 sources identified, 18 were included. Data on oral diseases and symptoms among older adults receiving HHCS were limited and heterogeneous. Overall, older adults often lacked some of their natural teeth and often had removable dentures that needed repair. In addition, plaque, caries, xerostomia, and chewing and swallowing problems were common among the population group. Data on OHRQoL were scarce and indicated a positive association with a higher number of present teeth, while decayed teeth, root remnants, and dry mouth had substantial negative impacts on the daily activities of older adults receiving HHCS.


CONCLUSION
This scoping review show that older adults above 65 years receiving HHCS generally have poor oral health status and that there is a knowledge gap regarding their OHRQoL.",0.0

15,15,Nurses’ Quality of Life and Healthy Behaviors,"Natalia Orszulak, Klaudia Kubiak, Adam Kowal",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2022,"Quality of life (QoL) is closely linked to the health status of the individual. In turn, health status strongly depends on lifestyle. Health behavior, which is defined as the actions and attitudes of a person that affect their physical and mental health, is one of many lifestyle components. The nursing community, which is exposed to a range of dangers associated with the job position and responsibilities of the nursing profession, has to contend with several negative impacts. This results in a decreased quality of life among the nursing staff and reduced effectiveness in providing care services to patients. Methods: This study was conducted using an online Google questionnaire, which was completed by 312 nurses nationwide. The questionnaire included questions about the respondents’ socio-demographic survey and included the Health Behavior Inventory (HBI) by Juczyński and the WHOQoL-BREF questionnaire. Results: The mean QoL reported by respondents was 3.65 points (SD = 0.67), meaning that QoL ranked between good and average results. The respondents’ mean rating of their own health was 3.58 points (SD = 0.79), indicating that they rated their health status between satisfactory and average. Low health-behavior prevalence was reported by 139 of the 312 survey participants (44.55%), while 111 respondents (35.58%) had average health-behavior prevalence and 62 (19.87%) had high health-behavior prevalence. Each of the QoL domains correlated significantly (p ˂ 0.05) and positively (r ˃ 0) with the total HBI score and all its subscales. Conclusions: Higher quality of life improves the level of health behavior by nursing staff. Obesity lowers the quality of life in physical, psychological, and social domains. The psychological sphere was the best-rated quality of life domain by nurses. A good material situation for nurses has a positive effect on their quality of life.",0.0

Coker · Mar 1, 202",Pediatrics,2022,"Quality improvement (QI) can be a critical means by which to achieve equity in health and health care. QI efforts, however, often fail to be designed and implemented through the lens of health equity. In this article, we will discuss the current state of the intersection between QI and health equity, then lay out specific steps researchers and practitioners can take to ensure that their QI work reduces, rather than increases or maintains, existing disparities. These steps include first, understanding existing disparities and, second, utilizing community engagement to ensure that QI enhances health equity. Before embarking on QI work, QI practitioners should first examine their metric of interest by patient characteristics, starting with race and ethnicity, language, and markers of access to care and socioeconomic status. Developing an understanding of existing disparities relevant to the QI project will ensure that the QI interventions can be designed to be most effective in the disadvantaged populations, thus increasing the likelihood that the intervention reduces existing disparities. In designing QI interventions, practitioners must also plan engagement with stakeholder populations ahead of time, to carefully understand their needs and priorities and how best to address them through QI efforts.",0.0

Kokol, Helena Blažun Vošner, Marko Kokol",Digital Health,2022,"The digitalization of healthcare fuelled by advances in technology and the increased prevalence of mobile smart devices and health-related internet of things can offer equitable access to expert-level healthcare globally. Growing demand for telemedicine, mobile health apps, and advanced data analytics have further established their role in a modern information society during the Covid-19 crisis. Digital health is, in essence, powered by software (DHSW), which has to operate in the specific digital health environment characteristics and is therefore highly and intrinsically complex and prone to software defects and faults. Given the lack of standardization regarding DHSW quality, we explored the available reviewed research on this crucial topic in this brief paper, using a synthetic thematic analysis approach. We assert that neither the volume, distribution nor scope of the DHSW quality research content is satisfactory, and significant research gaps exist. Based on the presented evidence, we can only conclude that we should be concerned and that the time to act is now to ensure that the unavoidable increase of usage and prevalence of DHSW will not – in the end – reduce the quality of care due to subpar software and software-based digital health systems.",0.0

Stamouli",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2022,"(1) Background: The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the health services’ internal quality level in Greek public hospitals and to investigate whether there is a relation between internal quality and health care professionals’ job satisfaction. (2) Material and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in six public hospitals (four general and two specialized hospitals). The following tools were used to collect data: (a) the SERVQUAL questionnaire, which is designed to measure service quality through five dimensions, and (b) the Job Satisfaction Survey (JSS) questionnaire, which is designed to measure employees’ job satisfaction. Convenience sampling was used as a sampling technique. (3) Results: The level of internal quality service was found to be low as regards the dimensions of: reliability, assurance, responsiveness, and empathy, while the “tangibles” dimension was the only one which was assessed as having a satisfactory internal quality level. Τhe results also revealed a positive correlation between the job satisfaction subscales and the quality dimensions. Regarding demographic characteristics and their effect on employees’ perceptions of internal quality dimensions, the study found that the gender and the educational factor had no effect while younger employees have a more positive perception of the quality of responsiveness dimension in the health organizations where they work. In terms of profession, administrative staff had a lower perception of the quality of tangibles dimension than doctors and nurses. Concerning years of experience, the results indicated that employees with more previous working experience had a worse perception of the quality of reliability, responsiveness, and assurance dimensions. (4) Conclusions: According to the results, establishing a sense of trust and understanding between management and health professionals through effective communication, transparent evaluation, and reward is critical to developing, enhancing, and promoting an internal quality culture in a hospital setting.",0.0

Design was assessed in 4/28 studies; information/content in 26/28 studies; usability in 12/28 studies; functionality in 10/28 studies; ethical issues were never assessed in any studies; security/privacy was not assessed; subjective assessment was made in 9/28 studies. 17/28 studies included apps that met the definition of ‘medical device’ according to MHRA guidance, yet only one app was appropriately certified with the UK Conformity Assessed (UKCA) mark.
 
 
 
 The quality of mHealth apps for burns are not being adequately assessed. The majority of apps should be considered medical devices according to UK standards, but only one was appropriately certified. Regulatory bodies should support mhealth app developers, so as to improve quality control whilst simultaneously fostering innovation.",0.06425982582068125

Polechoński",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2022,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the intensity of health behaviors and health-related quality of life in female mid-level medical staff. The study group consisted of 153 female mid-level medical staff members. The intensity of health behaviors was examined with the Polish version of Health Behavior Inventory. Health-related quality of life was verified with the Short Form Health Survey questionnaire (SF 36v2). Among the participants, 33% had low, 39% average, and 28% high intensity of health behaviors. The mental component of health-related quality of life was rated higher (83.3 ± 15.3 points) compared to the physical one. The lowest health-related quality of life was observed in the domain of “bodily pain”, while the highest was found for the domain of “social functioning”. Both the physical and mental components of health-related quality of life were significantly positively correlated with health behavior prevalence in all its categories. The post-hoc tests revealed the variation in physical and mental components of HRQoL according to the level of health behavior intensity.",0.09504055301882194
22,22,Effects of Health Insurance on Quality of Care in Low-Income Countries: A Systematic Review,"Doris Osei Afriyie, Brendan Kwesiga, Grace Achungura",Public Health Reviews,2023,"Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of health insurance on quality of care in low-income countries (LICs). Methods: We conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines. We searched seven databases for studies published between 2010 and August 2022. We included studies that evaluated the effects of health insurance on quality of care in LICs using randomized experiments or quasi-experimental study designs. Study outcomes were classified using the Donabedian framework. Results: We included 15 studies out of the 6,129 identified. Available evidence seems to suggest that health insurance has limited effects on structural quality, and its effects on the process of care remain mixed. At the population level, health insurance is linked to improved anthropometric measures for children and biomarkers such as blood pressure and hemoglobin levels. Conclusion: Based on the currently available evidence, it appears that health insurance in LICs has limited effects on the quality of care. Further studies are required to delve into the mechanisms that underlie the impact of health insurance on the quality of care and identify the most effective strategies to ensure quality within insurance programs.

23,23,Consumers’ Evaluation of Web-Based Health Information Quality: Meta-analysis,"Yan Zhang, Yeolib Kim · Jan 15, 202",Journal of Medical Internet Research,2022,"Background The internet has become a major source of health information for general consumers. Web-based health information quality varies widely across websites and applications. It is critical to understand the factors that shape consumers’ evaluation of web-based health information quality and the role that it plays in their appraisal and use of health information and information systems. Objective This paper aimed to identify the antecedents and consequences of consumers’ evaluation of web-based health information quality as a means to consolidate the related research stream and to inform future studies on web-based health information quality. Methods We systematically searched 10 databases, examined reference lists, and conducted manual searches. Empirical studies that investigated consumers’ evaluation of web-based health information quality, credibility, or trust and their respective relationships with antecedents or consequences were included. Results We included 147 studies reported in 136 papers in the analysis. Among the antecedents of web-based health information quality, system navigability (ρ=0.56), aesthetics (ρ=0.49), and ease of understanding (ρ=0.49) had the strongest relationships with web-based health information quality. The strongest consequences of web-based health information quality were consumers’ intentions to use health information systems (ρ=0.58) and satisfaction with health information (ρ=0.46). Web-based health information quality relationships were moderated by numerous cultural dimensions, research designs, and publication moderators. Conclusions Consumers largely rely on peripheral cues and less on cues that require more information processing (eg, content comprehensiveness) to determine web-based health information quality. Surprisingly, the relationships between individual differences and web-based health information quality are trivial. Web-based health information quality has stronger effects on cognitive appraisals and behavioral intentions than on behavior. Despite efforts to include various moderators, a substantial amount of variance is still unexplained, indicating a need to study additional moderators. This meta-analysis provides broad and consistent evidence for web-based health information quality relationships that have been fractured and incongruent in empirical studies.",0.0
24,24,Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) of People over 65 Years of Age,"Marlena Krawczyk-Suszek, A. Kleinrok · Jan 1, 202",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2022,"Quality of life is an important indicator of the treatment process, lifestyle, and influence of many other factors, both exogenous and endogenous, on the body. Determining the quality of life of healthy people (health-related quality of life (HRQoL), considering the influence of various factors, is important due to the possibility of making subsequent comparative analyses regarding the quality of life of people diagnosed with diseases. In addition, it allows us to identify the most crucial factors influencing the HRQoL in the process of “good aging”. The purpose of the study was to present the HRQoL level of healthy people over 65 years of age. HRQoL was measured in five-year age groups (66–70, 71–75, 76–80, >80 years), considering the analyzed factors. Finally, 1038 healthy people were included in the study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: no diagnosed chronic diseases, no permanent treatment in specialist clinics, and no constant administration of medicaments. A comparative analysis was carried out, assuming a 5% conclusion error. The SF-36 questionnaire assessing the main dimensions of the quality of life was the tool used in the study to assess the HRQoL: the physical component summary (PCS), mental component summary (MCS) and index of life quality (ILQ). The factors significantly differentiating the average level of HRQoL were as follows: gender, place of residence, education, employment status, smoking and physical activity. Relationship status (p > 0.05) was one of the analyzed factors that did not influence the differences in the average level of the perceived HRQoL. More than a twofold greater chance of a higher HRQoL was reported in the group of men under 75 years of age (66–70: OR = 2.01; 71–75: OR = 2.52) compared to the group of women. The same relationship was noted in the case of higher education in respondents up to the age of 80 (66–70: OR = 1.56; 71–75: OR = 2.16; 76–80: OR = 2.74). Smoking by people over 80 years of age significantly increased the chances of a higher HRQoL in each of the dimensions (PCS: OR = 4.09; MCS: OR = 12.64; ILQ: OR = 5.79). Age as a non-modifiable factor significantly differentiates the level of the HRQoL of healthy people over 65 years of age. The results of the conducted study on HRQoL can be helpful when comparing the HRQoL of healthy people with a group of people with chronic diseases.",0.0
25,25,"Is thematic analysis used well in health psychology? A critical review of published research, with recommendations for quality practice and reporting","Virginia Braun, Victoria Clarke · Jan 19, 202",Health Psychology Review,2023,"ABSTRACT Despite the persistent dominance of a ‘scientific psychology’ paradigm in health psychology, the use of qualitative research continues to grow. Qualitative approaches are often based on fundamentally different values from (post)positivistempiricism, raising important considerations for quality, and whether qualitative work adheres to, and is judged by, appropriate publication standards. Thematic analysis (TA) has become a particularly popular method in qualitative health psychology, but poor practice is widespread. To support high quality, methodologically coherent TA practice and reporting, we critically reviewed 100 systematically selected papers reporting TA, published in five prominent health psychology journals. Our review assessed reported practice, and considered this in relation to methodological and quality recommendations. We identified 10 common areas of problematic practice in the reviewed papers, the majority citing reflexive TA. Considering the role of three ‘arbiters of quality’ in a peer review publication system – authors, reviewers, and editors – we developed 20 recommendations for authors, to support them in conducting and reporting high quality TA research, with associated questions for reviewers and editors to consider when evaluating TA manuscripts for publication. We end with considerations for facilitating better qualitative research, and enriching the understandings and knowledge base from which health psychology is practiced.",0.0

This study documents the quality of diets among older Americans and implications of healthy eating for their physical and mental health. Using a nationally representative longitudinal sample of adults aged ≥50 years, from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) 2010–2016 and food intake data from the 2013 Health Care and Nutrition Study (HCNS), the study evaluates the onset of health problems along the spectrum of diet quality measured by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015. Older adults adhering to healthier diets, in the high HEI group, have a significantly lower risk of developing limitations in activities of daily living (15.2% vs. 19.6%, p < 0.01) and depression (11.8% vs. 14.9%, p < 0.01), as compared to participants with low HEI scores. Consuming healthier diets also predicts more favorable health outcomes, as measured by blood-based biomarkers, including C-reactive protein (3.3 vs. 3.8, p < 0.05), cystatin C (1.1 vs. 1.2, p < 0.1), total cholesterol (192.1 vs. 196.4, p < 0.1), and high-density lipoprotein (57.2 vs. 53.8, p < 0.01).

29,29,Association of measured quality with financial health among U.S. hospitals,"Samuel J Enumah, Andrew S. Resnick, D. Chang · Apr 20, 202",PLoS ONE,2022,"Background High-quality care is a clear objective for hospital leaders, but hospitals must balance investing in quality with financial stability. Poor hospital financial health can precipitate closure, limiting patients’ access to care. Whether hospital quality is associated with financial health remains poorly understood. The objective of this study was to compare financial performance at high-quality and low-quality hospitals. Methods We performed a retrospective observational cohort study of U.S. hospitals using the American Hospital Association and Hospital Compare datasets for years 2013 to 2018. We used multilevel mixed-effects linear and logistic regression models with fixed year effects and random intercepts for hospitals to identify associations between hospitals’ measured quality outcomes—30-day hospital-wide readmission rate and the patient safety indicator-90 (PSI-90)—and their financial margins and risk of financial distress in the same year and the subsequent year. Our sample included 20,919 observations from 4,331 unique hospitals. Results In 2018, the median 30-day readmission rate was 15.2 (interquartile range [IQR] 14.8–15.6), the median PSI-90 score was 0.96 (IQR 0.89–1.07), the median operating margin was -1.8 (IQR -9.7–5.9), and 750 (22.7%) hospitals experienced financial distress. Hospitals in the best quintile of readmission rates experienced higher operating margins (+0.95%, 95% CI [0.51–1.39], p < .001) and lower odds of distress (odds ratio [OR] 0.56, 95% CI [0.45–0.70], p < .001) in the same year as compared to hospitals in the worst quintile. Hospitals in the best quintile of PSI-90 had higher operating margins (+0.62%, 95% CI [0.17–1.08], p = .007) and lower odds of financial distress (OR 0.70, 95% CI [0.55–0.89], p = .003) as compared to hospitals in the worst quintile. The results were qualitatively similar for the same-year and lag-year analyses.

31,31,Composite measures of quality of health care: Evidence mapping of methodology and reporting,"P. Kara, J. Valentin, J. Mainz",PLoS ONE,2022,"Background Quality indicators are used to quantify the quality of care. A large number of quality indicators makes assessment of overall quality difficult, time consuming and impractical. There is consequently an increasing interest for composite measures based on a combination of multiple indicators. Objective To examine the use of different approaches to construct composite measures of quality of care and to assess the use of methodological considerations and justifications. Methods We conducted a literature search on PubMed and EMBASE databases (latest update 1 December 2020). For each publication, we extracted information on the weighting and aggregation methodology that had been used to construct composite indicator(s). Results A total of 2711 publications were identified of which 145 were included after a screening process. Opportunity scoring with equal weights was the most used approach (86/145, 59%) followed by all-or-none scoring (48/145, 33%). Other approaches regarding aggregation or weighting of individual indicators were used in 32 publications (22%). The rationale for selecting a specific type of composite measure was reported in 36 publications (25%), whereas 22 papers (15%) addressed limitations regarding the composite measure. Conclusion Opportunity scoring and all-or-none scoring are the most frequently used approaches when constructing composite measures of quality of care. The attention towards the rationale and limitations of the composite measures appears low. Discussion Considering the widespread use and the potential implications for decision-making of composite measures, a high level of transparency regarding the construction process of the composite and the functionality of the measures is crucial.",0.0
32,32,Developing Meaningful Health Care Quality Metrics: An Example From Colonoscopy and Adenoma Detection,"D. Corley · Sep 27, 202",Annals of Internal Medicine,2022,"Health care quality is important. The World Health Organization defines health care quality as “the degree to which health services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes” (1). Thus, care must be both effective and broadly delivered. Quality measures and metrics help clinicians understand how we are doing and what we need to improve (2). However, although the adage “if you measure it, it gets done” is often true, it ignores the question of whether “it” is worth measuring at all. Extensive research addresses health care quality. Frameworks describe quality at the patient, provider, system, and societal levels, and via interpersonal and technical domains; frameworks also describe how measures can evaluate structures, processes, and outcomes (3–6). They include criteria such as feasibility, usability, importance, and scientific soundness. Pragmatic health care quality metrics would benefit from considering some concepts common in the business world, such as timeliness, strategy, and ownership (7, 8). In their article, Wisse and colleagues report a study that evaluates cancer screening quality with a common procedure: colonoscopy to follow a positive fecal immunochemical test (FIT) result in the Netherlands' screening program (9). It is useful to evaluate this example considering quality concepts from both the health care and business worlds. The Netherlands' colorectal cancer screening program has used impressive, evidence-based practices throughout its existence, including modeling to estimate risk, benefit, and person-power. The quality metric evaluated is the adenoma detection rate (ADR)—the percentage of colonoscopy examinations for a FIT-positive indication performed by a given endoscopist in which a precancerous polyp (that is, an adenoma) is detected. The outcome is postcolonoscopy risk for cancer. The quality of the colonoscopic examinations in the program is high: endoscopists' ADRs range between 40% and 82% with a median of 67%. Higher ADRs are strongly associated with lower patient risks for subsequent cancer (10). Even within this high range, likely from the higher-risk FIT-positive population, the associations are remarkably consistent with prior evaluations of lower-risk screening colonoscopies: every 1% increase in ADR is associated with a 4% to 5% reduction in the risk for postcolonoscopy cancers (10). These seemingly small ADR differences are deceptive—if an endoscopist increases their ADR by just 10%, their patients' associated decrease in relative interval cancer risk is a remarkable 40% to 50%. And this estimate is likely conservative, given the study excluded some cancers, and modeling studies suggest that, over a lifetime, higher ADRs are associated with even greater cancer prevention. This study provides an excellent framework for evaluating 9 concepts regarding effective quality metrics and how these can illustrate pathways for meaningful metrics for the care of other cancers and disorders. This is crucial, as metrics can be laboriously implemented without improving outcomes. Trustworthy: There is a clear, standard, transparent, reproducible, and accurate method for calculating and reporting the metric. Wisse and colleagues demonstrate trustworthiness in the use of clear definitions for adenoma detection, interval cancer, and other measures. Important: Leaders and clinicians who receive feedback must know the quality measure is clinically meaningful and, thus, important. Compelling observational data have reproducibly associated endoscopist ADR with meaningful differences in patient outcomes. Strategic: A strategic metric's development starts with the clinical goal in mind and then likely causal factors are identified, rather than using process measures of unclear importance. It also aligns with global organizational strategies. Here, the outcome is important (postcolonoscopy cancers and associated deaths), the metric itself is causally associated (identification of precancerous polyps for removal), and these are closely aligned with the screening program's strategic goals (decreasing cancer deaths). Relevant: The targets and methods should be applicable for the local setting. This is the key unique aspect of Wisse and colleagues' study. The consensus ADR standards created for colonoscopy screening programs were not relevant for the Netherlands' FIT-based program as most colonoscopies were for higher-risk FIT-positive patients. The investigators are to be commended for recognizing and using a relevant metric for their setting. Actionable: Effort should only be expended on measuring things that result in actions that improve outcomes. For example, inspection time during colonoscopy or “withdrawal time” has been proposed as a metric, but interventions solely focused on this measure did not consistently improve polyp detection or cancer prevention. In contrast, improvements in adenoma detection have been associated with improved subsequent cancer risk. Simple: Metrics should be straightforward to calculate, to understand, and to associate with the strategic goal. Complex mathematical models or multiple measures may impede adoption and obfuscate interventions. Incentives, if provided, should be clear, achievable, and timely. Conceptually, adenoma detection is simple to calculate, though, in some settings, the lack of electronic pathology or indication data impedes its use. However, Wisse and colleagues demonstrate that ADR is feasible to calculate. Gaming-resistant: Ideally, metrics should be calculated independent of the entity being evaluated. In the current example, neither the colonoscopy indication (FIT positivity) nor the pathology result (presence of adenoma on biopsy) is determined by the endoscopist. Time-stamped: The provision of recent data and feedback at regular intervals is needed to inform actionable",0.0
33,33,Health-related quality of life and associated factors among cancer patients in Ethiopia: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"Tadele Lankrew Ayalew, Belete Gelaw Wale, Kirubel Haile",PLOS ONE,2022,"Introduction Cancer is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in every part of the world, regardless of human development. Cancer patients exhibit a wide range of signs and symptoms. Being diagnosed with cancer has a variety of consequences that can affect one’s quality of life. The term ""health-related quality of life"" refers to a multidimensional concept that encompasses a person’s whole health. The availability of data on the prevalence of poor quality of life among cancer patients in Ethiopia is critical in order to focus on early detection and enhance cancer treatment strategies. In Ethiopia, however, there is a scarcity of information. As a result, the aim of this study was to determine the pooled estimated prevalence of quality of life among cancer patients in Ethiopia. Materials and methods This systematic review and meta-analysis were searched through MEDLINE, Pub Med, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar by using different search terms on the prevalence of health-related quality of life of cancer patients and Ethiopia. Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument was used for critical appraisal of studies. The analysis was done using STATA 14 software. The Cochran Q test and I2 test statistics were used to test the heterogeneity of studies. The funnel plot and Egger’s test were used to show the publication bias. The pooled prevalence of health-related quality of life of cancer with a 95% confidence interval was presented using forest plots. Results A total of 12 studies with 3, 479 participants were included in this review and the overall pooled estimates mean score of health-related quality of life among cancer patients in Ethiopia was 57.91(44.55, 71.27, I2 = 98.8%, p≤0.001). Average monthly income (AOR:3.70;95%CI:1.31,6.10), Stage of cancer (AOR:4.92;95% CI:2.96,6.87), Physical functioning(AOR:4.11;95%CI:1.53,6.69), Social functioning(AOR:3.91;95% CI:1.68,6.14) were significantly associated with quality of life. Subgroup meta-analysis of health-related quality of life of cancer patients in Ethiopia done by region showed that a higher in Addis Ababa 83.64(78.69, 88.60), and lower in SNNP region16.22 (11.73, 20.71), and subgroup analysis done based on the type of cancer showed that higher prevalence of health-related quality of life among cancer patients was breast cancer 83.64(78.69, 88.60). Conclusion This review showed that the overall health related quality of life was above an average. Furthermore, average monthly income, cancer stage, physical, and social functioning were all significant determinants in cancer patients’ QOL.as a result, this review suggests that quality of life evaluation be incorporated into a patient’s treatment routine, with a focus on linked components and domains, as it is a critical tool for avoiding and combating the effects of cancer and considerably improving overall health.

In general, from the viewpoint of service receivers, the technical quality is relatively favorable. Conclusions: According to the results of this study, the quality of health care in Iran is significantly far from ideal. Therefore, planning to improve providing health care is essential.",0.0
35,35,Role of diet quality in bone health in children and adolescents: a systematic review.,"L. Suhett, M. Filgueiras, Juliana Farias de Novaes",Nutrition reviews,2023,"CONTEXT
Poor diet quality and unhealthy dietary patterns have been linked to poor bone health, yet few studies have investigated the role of diet quality in bone health in pediatric populations.


OBJECTIVE
This systematic review aims to assess the available evidence on the association between diet quality and bone health markers in children and adolescents.


DATA SOURCES
The PubMed, Scopus, and Virtual Health Library databases were searched electronically from October to November 2022, without any restrictions on date or language. The STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) checklist was used to assess the quality of the studies.


DATA EXTRACTION
Published observational studies in children and adolescents (ages 2 to 19 years) that investigated the association between diet quality and bone health were eligible for inclusion. Two researchers independently analyzed and selected all articles using the Rayyan app. Initially, 965 papers were identified. A total of 12 observational studies qualified, including 8 cross-sectional and 4 longitudinal studies. The sample comprised 7130 individuals aged 3 to 17.9 years, representing both sexes. Bone health was evaluated by measures of bone mineral density and bone mineral content.


DATA ANALYSIS
Seven studies (58.3%) showed significant associations between diet quality and bone health markers, all of which evaluated diet quality by identifying dietary patterns. Diet quality as evaluated by all dietary indexes was not associated with bone health markers.


CONCLUSIONS
Adherence to a healthy diet may benefit bone health in children and adolescents. These findings emphasize the importance of developing effective public health policies that encourage healthy eating habits from childhood to preserve bone health. Longitudinal research using a specific tool to assess diet quality in relation to bone health is warranted. Future studies should also measure bone-regulating hormones and markers of bone turnover.

To examine how these strategies have been shaped in different jurisdictions, we carried out this study. We conducted a web-based comparative study of international practices. We first defined seven key health care and services quality management functions. We then drew on the experience of authors to make a reasoned selection of 13 countries or states across the world. We determined the distance that separates each of these functions from a country's Ministry of Health (MoH); and examined whether these functions are concentrated in a single organisation or dispersed across several organisations. Afterwards, we correlated our results with the quality level of these countries based on the OECD's health care indicators. Overall, Netherlands, Québec (Canada), Korea, Germany, England (UK), and the United States had at least 50% of their quality management functions controlled by self-regulated organisations. The Market Concentration Index ranged from 937 for the United States to 6800 for Russia. Graphical representation has shown us two health system models. Our results also clearly showed that countries had a better quality of care most often when they belong to model 1 of our taxonomy. These findings will help countries design and implement large-scale health care and services quality strategies for better and safer health care and services.",0.0
37,37,Investigation of the Associations between Diet Quality and Health-Related Quality of Life in a Sample of Swedish Adolescents,"Callum Regan, Hedda Walltott, Karin Kjellenberg",Nutrients,2022,"Most adolescents do not consume a high-quality diet, while self-reported mental health problems within this group are increasing. This study aimed to investigate the association between diet quality and health-related quality of life, and to explore the differences in diet quality and health-related quality of life between gender and parental education status. In this cross-sectional study, a detailed web-based recall method was implemented to determine dietary intake, which was analysed using the newly developed Swedish Healthy Eating Index for Adolescents 2015 (SHEIA15) and the Riksmaten Adolescents Diet Diversity Score (RADDS), to determine diet quality. The KIDSCREEN-10 questionnaire was used to measure health-related quality of life, and parental education was self-reported through questionnaires. Parental education was divided into two groups: ≤12 years or >12 years. The study included 1139 adolescents from grade 7 (13–14 years old), 51% were girls. The results showed that girls had higher scores for healthy eating and diet diversity but lower scores for health-related quality of life. A positive association was found between diet diversity and health-related quality of life (Adj R2 = 0.072, p = 0.001), between vegetable/fruit consumption and health-related quality of life (Adj R2 = 0.071, p = 0.002), and between healthy eating and diet diversity (Adj R2 = 0.214, p < 0.001). No association was found between healthy eating and health-related quality of life for all participants. The mean scores for healthy eating and diet diversity were significantly higher in the higher education parental group. In conclusion, higher diet diversity and increased fruit and vegetable consumption could be a strategy to improve health-related quality of life among adolescents. There is a need to promote better diet quality, especially in households of low parental education. In addition, there is a further need to investigate the potential benefits of improved diet quality on mental health and overall well-being.",0.0
38,38,Quality of health care in Germany: results of a pilot study to assess health system performance,"S. Schwaabe · Oct 1, 202",The European Journal of Public Health,2022,"Abstract Background Health System Performance Assessment (HSPA) is used as a tool to monitor and evaluate the performance of health systems and to inform evidence-based policymaking. For the first time, a systematic HSPA was piloted for Germany. The conceptual framework includes different dimensions, e.g., access, population health, efficiency, and quality of care. In the following, Germany’s performance is analysed in terms of quality of care. Methods Indicators to assess the dimension of quality of care were selected based on a systematic search of established instruments in national and international HSPA initiatives. Other criteria for the inclusion of indicators were data availability and international comparability. The indicators were evaluated in terms of their time trend (2000-2020) and in international comparison (e.g., Austria, Denmark, France). Results Overall, 17 indicators were selected to assess quality of care, of which two could not be analysed due to missing data. Indicators include, e.g., emergency readmissions after hospital stays, patient-reported medical errors, coercive measures in psychiatric wards, and in-hospital mortality. Trend analyses were possible for 14 indicators and most of them showed positive developments. In country comparisons, which were feasible for seven indicators, Germany mostly ranked below average. In-hospital mortality for acute myocardial infarction, e.g., was 8% in 2019 in Germany (other countries: 4%-7%) and has been stable since 2014. For stroke, Germany performs better and ranks three of five (6%; range: 5%-9%) in 2019. Conclusions Measuring quality of care for a systematic and comparative German HSPA was proven to be feasible. However, some indicators could not be mapped so far due to lack of data. The results give insights into quality measurements across different sectors and can support evidence-based policymaking. Key messages • In the first health system performance assessment (HSPA) for Germany, quality of care was evaluated over time (2000-2020) and compared to eight European countries using 17 indicators. • Measurement of quality was feasible, but data availability should be strengthened in the future as country comparisons were possible for only half the indicators and two could not be analysed at all.",0.031143265177928346

Mantzorou, Gavriela Voulgaridou",Nutrients,2023,"This study aims to explore the associations between nutritional status and health-related quality of life, physical activity, and sleep quality in older exclusively Caucasian adults from Greec who were free of any severe disease. This is a cross-sectional study. Mini Nutritional Assessment was used to assess nutritional status, health-related quality of life was assessed using the Short Form Healthy Survey questionnaire, sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and physical activity levels were assessed via the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. 3405 community-dwelling men and women, over 65 years old from14 different Greek regions were enrolled. Ten-point four percent (10.4%) of the participants were classified as malnourished, while 35.6% were “at risk of malnutrition”. A better nutritional status was significantly and independently associated with higher physical activity levels (p = 0.0011) and better quality of life (p = 0.0135), as well as better sleep quality (p = 0.0202). In conclusion, our study highlights the interrelationships between a good nutritional status, a high-quality sleep, active lifestyle, and good quality of life. Further interventional studies are needed to clarify the associations, and test the feasibility of improving the nutritional status, physical activity levels and sleep quality of the elderly, and the impact of these changes on quality of life, and healthy ageing in races beyond Caucasian populations. Public health strategies and policies should be recommended to inform older adults for the necessity to improve their nutritional status and lifestyle habits to improve their health status and to obtain better life expectancy.",0.0
40,40,Quality Measures for Patients at Risk of Adverse Outcomes in the Veterans Health Administration: Expert Panel Recommendations.,"Evelyn T. Chang, S. Newberry, L. Rubenstein",JAMA network open,2022,"Importance
Despite longstanding efforts to improve health care quality for patients with complex needs who are at highest risk for hospitalization or death, to our knowledge, no guidance exists on what constitutes measurable high-quality care for this heterogeneous population. Identifying quality measures that are cross-cutting (ie, relevant to multiple chronic conditions and disease states) may enable health care professionals and health care systems to better design and report on quality improvement efforts for this patient population.


Objective
To identify quality measures of care and prioritize quality-of-care concepts in the ambulatory primary care setting for patients in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) who have complex care needs and are at high risk for adverse outcomes, such as hospitalization or death.


Evidence Review
In this expert panel assessment and prioritization, relevant measure concepts for future quality measure development in 3 care categories (assessment, management, and other features of health care) were extracted from a systematic review, conducted from June 2020 to June 2021, of published studies that suggested, evaluated, or used indicators of quality care for patients at high risk of adverse outcomes. Measure concepts associated with single conditions, surgical or other specialty care settings, and inpatient care were excluded. A panel of 14 experts (10 VHA leaders and staff, 2 non-VHA physician investigators, and 2 veterans) discussed and rated the importance of the remaining set of potentially relevant measure concepts using a modified RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method on January 15, 2021. Measure concepts were rated on a scale of 1 to 9, with 9 being the highest priority. A median rating of 7.5 or greater was used as the cutoff to identify the highest-priority items.


Findings
The systematic review identified 519 measure concepts, from which 15 domains and 49 measure concepts were proposed for expert panel consideration. After panel discussions and changes to measure concepts, the expert panel rated 63 measure concepts in 13 domains. The measure concepts with the highest median ratings focused on caregiver availability and support, COVID-19 vaccination, and pneumonia vaccination (all rated 9.0); housing instability (rated 8.5); and physical function, depression symptoms, cognitive impairment, prescription regimen, primary care follow-up after an emergency department visit or hospitalization, and timely transmission of discharge information to primary care (all rated 8.0). Recommendations to improve care included timely assessment of housing instability, caregiver support, physical function, depression symptoms, and cognitive impairment; annual prescription regimen review; coordinated transitions in care; and preventive care including vaccinations.


Conclusions and Relevance
The expert panelists identified a parsimonious set of high-priority, evidence-based, cross-cutting quality measure concepts for improving care of patients at high risk for adverse health outcomes in the VHA. These quality measures may inform both future research for patients at high risk and health care system quality improvement.",0.0
41,41,Quality of Life During Pregnancy from 2011 to 2021: Systematic Review,"A. Boutib, S. Chergaoui, A. Marfak",International Journal of Women's Health,2022,"Purpose Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has emerged as a key concern in patient care. It has become one of the major objectives of clinical trials. Our study aims to describe the quality of life (QoL) during uncomplicated pregnancy and to assess its associated factors. Patients and Methods The search of articles was carried out using the online database of PUBMED and Web of Science with a limit of time between 2011 and 2021. Data were retrieved by two independent reviewers. Results 721 publications responding to keywords were identified, of which 73 articles on the topic were selected. The main countries that have published on this subject are Australia (n = 10) and China (n = 7). Twenty-three articles deal with QoL for pathological pregnancies. All the pathologies studied have a negative impact on the HRQoL of pregnant women, and its improvement depends on the type of treatment. Obesity, low back, and pelvic girdle pain, and hyperemesis gravidarum were the frequent pathologies during pregnancy. Socio-demographic characteristics related to improved well-being (favorable economic status, social support). Similarly, better sleep quality and moderate physical exercise were linked to an increased QoL. Physical and psychological factors were associated with a lower QoL. Conclusion The HRQoL refers to patients’ subjective evaluation of physical, mental, and social components of well-being. Optimizing the QoL during pregnancy necessitates a deeper understanding of their issues as well as counseling which provides support wherever needed.",0.0

Krasowska · Jun 26, 202",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2022,"Introduction: The Servqual (an acronym from the words “service” and “quality”) method is used to assess the quality of provided services on the basis of standardised evaluation parameters. This method is based on five gaps resulting from the discrepancy between expected and received service quality. The aim of this meta-analysis and the systematic review was to view and assess the major differences in the five dimensions of the Servqual method used to evaluate the quality of delivered health care services in selected Asian countries. Another goal of the study was to confirm the use of the Servqual method as a suitable tool for assessing the quality of health care services. Methods: This study followed the PRISMA guidelines for systemic reviews and meta-analyses. The following electronic databases for medical publications were used: PubMed, Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane were searched for articles published from January 2000 to April 2020. The databases were explored with original search queries containing the following terms: “Servqual”, “service quality”, “Servqual model”, “servqual questionnaire”, “health service quality”, “health care services”, “patients’ expectation”, “patients’ perception”, “expectation”, “perception”, and “health care services”, in combination using “AND” and “OR”. In order to minimize bias, two researchers (PK and DK) independently performed an online search for peer-reviewed papers, using the combinations of the above-mentioned words. In addition, references of eligible publications were checked. All disagreements, regarding the inclusion or exclusion of specific studies, were resolved through consultations among all the authors. Results: A total of 96 reports were identified and submitted to a preliminary screening selection. As a result of the pre-screening stage, 64 papers were qualified to further evaluation. The output of the evaluation brought 15 reported studies, meeting the pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria. The total number of participants was 5903 (ranging from 20 to 439 in individual reports), and 54% of them were women. Eight studies (53%) were from Iran, two from Pakistan (13%) and one each from Arabia, Malaysia, South Korea, Bangladesh, and Iraq (each-about 7%). The results showed gaps between patients’ expectations and perceptions in all five dimensions of Servqual in almost each analysed study. The highest and lowest values of the gaps in quality scores were associated with the dimensions of reliability, tangibility, empathy, and responsiveness, respectively. Conclusions: The study demonstrated that the method of Servqual is broadly used in various medical sectors to assess the quality of medical services provided. In addition, the study demonstrated that patients had significantly higher expectations of the medical services offered in the five dimensions studied. The results, obtained through the Servqual method, may help improve and monitor the quality of services provided by different institutions.",0.10404936848169756
43,43,Public Reporting Of Hospital Quality Measures Has Not Led To Overall Quality Improvement: Evidence From Germany.,"E. E. Bayindir, Jonas Schreyögg · Apr 1, 202",Health affairs,2023,"Hospital quality has been measured and made publicly available for decades in the US and for more than a decade in Germany, as part of an effort to help those countries achieve quality improvement. The German hospital market presents a unique opportunity to examine the relationship between public reporting and quality improvement in the absence of performance-linked payment incentives in a high-income country. We considered quality indicators from several important categories of health services provided in hospitals (hip, knee, obstetrics, neonatology, heart, neck artery surgery, pressure ulcers, and pneumonia), using structured hospital quality reports from the period 2012-19. Our findings support the idea that public reporting provides a quality benchmark and prevents the provision of very low quality health care services, suggesting that imposing financial punishment on low performers is not necessary and may hinder quality improvement and aggravate health disparities. Although hospitals' intrinsic motivation and market forces play roles in improving quality, they are not sufficient to maintain the quality of high-performing hospitals. Therefore, in addition to rewarding high-performing institutions, aligning quality incentives with the intrinsic professional values of clinical care may be useful in achieving quality improvement.",0.0
44,44,The role of health-related quality of life in improving cancer outcomes,"J. Nolazco, Steven L. Chang · Mar 28, 202",Journal of Clinical and Translational Research,2023,"In 1948, the World Health Organization defined health as “a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” This perspective emphasizes that health goes beyond merely being free from illness, encompassing numerous aspects of an individual’s well-being [1]. With the ongoing evolution of oncology and the promising potential of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) to enhance cancer patient outcomes, an exceptional opportunity for improving health emerges. Despite significant progress in grasping disease progression and treatment efficacy, an urgent need persists in harnessing HRQoL’s power [2]. Actively gathering “non-clinical” information from cancer survivors during various stages of diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship allows health-care professionals to obtain crucial insights into factors affecting patient outcomes [3]. Employing this approach, clinicians can more effectively customize treatments to address individual patient requirements, ultimately boosting the overall QoL for those with cancer. Consequently, it is essential to acknowledge HRQoL’s significance and capitalize on these factors’ opportunities for advancement.",0.0
45,45,Introduction to quality improvement: From corridor conversation to system change,"A. Matthews, Adelene Hilbig · Aug 26, 202",Emergency Medicine Australasia,2023,"Improving the health of a population is the distilled aim of any health system, often concealed within a myriad of complex processes and pathways. Quality improvement (QI) is the combined and unceasing efforts of all in this space – clinicians, administrators, patients and others – to uphold this focus and make changes that produce better system performance and patient outcomes. Here, we introduce relevant definitions, methodologies and ethics for clinicians new to QI. The manufacturing industry has been credited with establishing the formal mechanisms we now recognise as QI. In the 1920s, statistician and mathematician Walter Shewhart described four sequential steps performed iteratively to better control manufacturing outputs: Plan, Do, Check/Study and Act. Deming, Juran and Ishikawa tailored the approach to Japanese manufacturing after World War II to reduce undesirable variability, improve production quality and lower costs. Similar methods were thereafter adopted across diverse industries, including healthcare, albeit sporadically prior to the 1980s. Forms of QI have existed in medicine for many centuries, including Florence Nightingale’s pioneering efforts in infection control. Progressive engagement with patients as stakeholders in their own care, and recognition that healthcare organisations and clinicians have a responsibility to improve the quality of care, have led to proliferation of QI initiatives. Ongoing investment in healthcare quality has generated numerous government and nongovernment QI agencies in support.",0.0
46,46,Comorbidity and health-related quality of life in people with a chronic medical condition in randomised clinical trials: An individual participant data meta-analysis,"E. Butterly, P. Hanlon, Anoop Shah",PLOS Medicine,2023,"Background Health-related quality of life metrics evaluate treatments in ways that matter to patients, so are often included in randomised clinical trials (hereafter trials). Multimorbidity, where individuals have 2 or more conditions, is negatively associated with quality of life. However, whether multimorbidity predicts change over time or modifies treatment effects for quality of life is unknown. Therefore, clinicians and guideline developers are uncertain about the applicability of trial findings to people with multimorbidity. We examined whether comorbidity count (higher counts indicating greater multimorbidity) (i) is associated with quality of life at baseline; (ii) predicts change in quality of life over time; and/or (iii) modifies treatment effects on quality of life. Methods and findings Included trials were registered on the United States trials registry for selected index medical conditions and drug classes, phase 2/3, 3 or 4, had ≥300 participants, a nonrestrictive upper age limit, and were available on 1 of 2 trial repositories on 21 November 2016 and 18 May 2018, respectively. Of 124 meeting these criteria, 56 trials (33,421 participants, 16 index conditions, and 23 drug classes) collected a generic quality of life outcome measure (35 EuroQol-5 dimension (EQ-5D), 31 36-item short form survey (SF-36) with 10 collecting both). Blinding and completeness of follow up were examined for each trial. Using trials where individual participant data (IPD) was available from 2 repositories, a comorbidity count was calculated from medical history and/or prescriptions data. Linear regressions were fitted for the association between comorbidity count and (i) quality of life at baseline; (ii) change in quality of life during trial follow up; and (iii) treatment effects on quality of life. These results were then combined in Bayesian linear models. Posterior samples were summarised via the mean, 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles as credible intervals (95% CI) and via the proportion with values less than 0 as the probability (PBayes) of a negative association. All results are in standardised units (obtained by dividing the EQ-5D/SF-36 estimates by published population standard deviations). Per additional comorbidity, adjusting for age and sex, across all index conditions and treatment comparisons, comorbidity count was associated with lower quality of life at baseline and with a decline in quality of life over time (EQ-5D −0.02 [95% CI −0.03 to −0.01], PBayes > 0.999). Associations were similar, but with wider 95% CIs crossing the null for SF-36-PCS and SF-36-MCS (−0.05 [−0.10 to 0.01], PBayes = 0.956 and −0.05 [−0.10 to 0.01], PBayes = 0.966, respectively). Importantly, there was no evidence of any interaction between comorbidity count and treatment efficacy for either EQ-5D or SF-36 (EQ-5D −0.0035 [95% CI −0.0153 to −0.0065], PBayes = 0.746; SF-36-MCS (−0.0111 [95% CI −0.0647 to 0.0416], PBayes = 0.70 and SF-36-PCS −0.0092 [95% CI −0.0758 to 0.0476], PBayes = 0.631. Conclusions Treatment effects on quality of life did not differ by multimorbidity (measured via a comorbidity count) at baseline—for the medical conditions studied, types and severity of comorbidities and level of quality of life at baseline, suggesting that evidence from clinical trials is likely to be applicable to settings with (at least modestly) higher levels of comorbidity.

Schröder",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2023,"The current paradigm of mental health care focuses on care provided in the community, increasingly moving away from hospital care models that involve considerable economic burden. Patient and staff perspectives on the quality of psychiatric care can highlight strengths and areas for improvement to ensure better care provision. The aim of this study was to describe and compare perceptions of quality of care among patients and staff in community mental health services and to determine possible relationships between these perceptions and other study variables. A comparative cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in a sample of 200 patients and 260 staff from community psychiatric care services in the area of Barcelona (Spain). The results showed high overall levels of quality of care from patient (m = 104.35 ± 13.57) and staff (m =102.06 ± 8.80) perspectives.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between family caregivers' health-related quality of life and health outcomes in care recipients.


METHODS
A total of 160 female caregivers in Japan were initially assessed using self-reported baseline questionnaires to determine physical and mental aspects of their health-related quality of life. Based on these scores, they were divided into three groups: lower, middle, and higher quality of life. We followed up with the 133 participants (after excluding those that did not respond) 6 years later to assess the health of their care recipients; 36 caregivers continued to provide home care, while 97 reported that their care recipient had died or been admitted into institutionalized care.


RESULTS
Statistically, a higher risk for care recipients' health deterioration was strongly associated with the mental component score in the lower caregivers' quality of life group of than for the middle group, after adjusting for the care recipients' age, health status, and caregivers' age at baseline. There was no significant association between deterioration of health of care recipients and physical component scores of the caregivers.

However, improving the health information quality of mHealth platforms is still a problem that needs to be studied and solved in order to make the platforms sustainable. Based on the reputation mechanism, this study creates a behavioral evolutionary game model for health information providers (physicians) and managers (mHealth platforms), explores the evolution process and evolutionarily stable strategy of the behaviors in various situations, and uses numerical simulation technology to analyze mHealth platforms' constraints and the influencing factors of health information quality. This study presents three key findings. First, considering reputation, health information managers and mHealth platform providers should not unilaterally optimize health information. Instead, mHealth platforms should have active quality control, and physician groups should provide high-quality health information, which is the ideal evolution of the model. Second, the rewards that physicians receive from patients and mHealth platforms for providing quality health information, the reputation benefits, the penalties that physicians suffer for providing low-quality health information, and the increased probability and cost of rent-seeking behavior that physicians may choose can effectively promote the choice of physicians to provide high-quality health information. Third, the reputation gain of mHealth platforms, the probability of mHealth platforms being exposed, and increased losses suffered from exposure can effectively promote the choice of mHealth platforms to control the quality of health information. This study can provide a theoretical basis for mHealth platforms' health information quality control, which is conducive to the healthy and sustainable development of mHealth platforms and the improvement of user satisfaction.",0.024620326756979047

Szlenk-Czyczerska, Marika Guzek, D. Bielska",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2022,"The World Health Organization defines quality of life as a person’s perception of his or her life situation in relation to the culture and value system in which he or she lives, in relation to and with respect to his or her functioning assumptions, expectations, and standards set by environmental conditions. Meeting the expectations of patients with CVD is one of the factors that positively influences their health status and leads to better diagnostic and treatment outcomes. The aim of this study was to answer three main questions related to patients with chronic cardiovascular disease: (1) What is their quality of life? (2) Are patients’ expectations about the quality of care provided by primary health care physicians/nurses met (and at what level)? (3) Is there a correlation between patients’ quality of life and their expectations of primary health care physicians/nurses? The study involved 193 Polish CVD patients who were cared for at home by a family nurse practitioner working in primary health care facilities. Data were collected from March 2016 to January 2017. The WHOQOL-BREF Quality of Life Questionnaire and the Author Interview Questionnaire were used for the study. Data analysis was based on the Spearman correlation coefficient test. There was a statistically significant association between patients’ expectations of the physician regarding information about the course of the disease and quality of life in the following domains: environmental r = 0.20, p = 0.006, psychological: r = 0.18, p = 0.015, physical: r = 0.18, p = 0.013, and social: r = 0.16, p = 0.025. Patients who did not expect the nurse to be courteous, understanding, or interested were found to have higher quality of life scores in psychological (r = −0.17, p = 0.023) and physical (r = −0.15, p = 0.044) domains. There was a statistically significant relationship between expectations of care from nurses regarding intimacy during care activities and the level of satisfaction with one’s own health (r = −0.15, p = 0.038) and quality of life (r = −0.14, p = 0.045), as well as quality of life in the domains of physical (r = 0.21, p = 0.004), social (r = 0.19, p = 0.010), and psychological (r = 0.16, p = 0.024). There is a need to define the expectations of patients with chronic cardiovascular disease in primary care, as lack of expectations of a physician/nurse continues to be associated with lower quality of life in all domains.",0.0
54,54,Bullying and Health Related Quality of Life among Adolescents—A Systematic Review,"V. Dubey, Justina Kievišienė, Alona Rauckiene-Michealsson",Children,2022,"Health-related quality of life is among global health goals not only in adulthood but also in childhood and adolescence. Being a multi-component construct, health-related quality of life covers various domains, such as physical and psychological wellbeing and social and environmental areas. Bullying might significantly influence those domains especially in adolescence, a period of life when numerous personal and interpersonal transformations are experienced. Therefore, the aim of the current systematic review was to provide a comprehensive overview of the relationship of bullying with the health-related quality of adolescents’ lives. An electronic literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, and 3621 full-text articles were identified. After a selection process, 12 studies covering diagnosis, prevention and treatment for each of the three sections “adolescents”, “health related quality of life” and “bullying” were reviewed. An overall reduction in health-related quality of life in regard to bullying appeared from the studies analyzed, as well as a decline in adolescent mental health. Different bullying types were identified as causing harm to various adolescents‘ health-related quality of life domains. These findings may contribute to effective bullying management in schools and/or societal settings, and inform intervention strategies for maintaining the quality of life of adolescents being bullied.",0.0
55,55,Review of the Impact of Housing Quality on Inequalities in Health and Well-Being.,"P. Howden-Chapman, Julie Bennett, R. Edwards",Annual review of public health,2022,"Housing quality is essential for population health and broader well-being. The World Health Organization housing and health guidelines highlight interventions that protect occupants from cold and hot temperatures, injuries, and other hazards. The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the importance of ventilation standards. Housing standards are unevenly developed, implemented, and monitored globally, despite robust research demonstrating that retrofitting existing houses and constructing high-quality new ones can reduce respiratory, cardiovascular, and infectious diseases. Indigenous peoples, ethnic minorities, and people with low incomes face cumulative disadvantages that are exacerbated by poor-quality housing. These can be partially ameliorated by community-based programs to improve housing quality, particularly for children and older people, who are hospitalized more often for housing-related illnesses. There is renewed interest among policy makers and researchers in the health and well-being of people in public and subsidized housing, who are disproportionately disadvantaged by avoidable housing-related diseases and injuries. Improving the overall quality of new and existing housing and neighborhoods has multiple cobenefits, including reducing carbon emissions.

57,57,Quality of Life Is Associated With Survival in Patients With Gastric Cancer: Results From the Randomized CRITICS Trial.,"R. V. van Amelsfoort, I. Walraven, J. Kieffer",Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,2022,"BACKGROUND
The evaluation of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in clinical trials has become increasingly important because it addresses the impact of treatment from the patient's perspective. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the effect of postoperative chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy (CRT) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery with extended (D2) lymphadenectomy on HRQoL in the CRITICS trial. Second, we investigated the potential prognostic value of pretreatment HRQoL on event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients in the CRITICS trial were asked to complete HRQoL questionnaires (EORTC Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-Core 30 and Quality-of-Life Questionnaire gastric cancer-specific module) at baseline, after preoperative chemotherapy, after surgery, after postoperative chemotherapy or CRT, and at 12 months follow-up. Patients with at least 1 evaluable questionnaire (645 of 788 randomized patients) were included in the HRQoL analyses. The predefined endpoints included dysphagia, pain, physical functioning, fatigue, and Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-Core 30 summary score. Linear mixed modeling was used to assess differences over time and at each time point. Associations of baseline HRQoL with EFS and OS were investigated using multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses.


RESULTS
At completion of postoperative chemo(radio)therapy, the chemotherapy group had significantly better physical functioning (P=.02; Cohen's effect size = 0.42) and less dysphagia (P=.01; Cohen's effect size = 0.38) compared with the CRT group. At baseline, worse social functioning (hazard ratio [HR], 2.20; 95% CI, 1.36-3.55; P=.001), nausea (HR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.39-2.56; P<.001), worse WHO performance status (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.13-2.13; P=.007), and histologic subtype (diffuse vs intestinal: HR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.42-2.67; P<.001; mixed vs intestinal: HR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.35-4.12; P=.003) were significantly associated with worse EFS and OS.


CONCLUSIONS
In the CRITICS trial, the chemotherapy group had significantly better physical functioning and less dysphagia after postoperative treatment. HRQoL scales at baseline were significantly associated with EFS and OS.",0.0
58,58,A systematic review of population and patient perspectives and experiences as measured in Latin American and Caribbean surveys.,"Jesús Medina-Ranilla, L. Espinoza, Agustina Mazzoni",Health policy and planning,2023,"High-quality health systems must provide accessible, people-centred care to both improve health and maintain population trust in health services. Furthermore, accurate measurement of population perspectives is vital to hold health systems accountable and to inform improvement efforts. To describe the current state of such measures in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), we conducted a systematic review of facility and population-based assessments that included patient-reported experience and satisfaction measures. Five databases were searched for publications on quantitative surveys assessing healthcare quality in Spanish- or Portuguese-speaking LAC countries, focusing on the domains of processes of care and quality impacts. We included articles published since 2011 with a national sampling frame or inclusion of multiple subnational regions. We tabulated and described these articles, identifying, classifying and summarizing the items used to assess healthcare quality into the domains mentioned earlier. Of the 5584 publications reviewed, 58 articles met our inclusion criteria. Most studies were cross-sectional (95%), assessed all levels of healthcare (57%) and were secondary analyses of existing surveys (86%). The articles yielded 33 unique surveys spanning 12 LAC countries; only eight of them are regularly administered surveys. The most common quality domains assessed were satisfaction (in 33 out of 58 articles, 57%), evidence-based/effective care (34%), waiting times (33%), clear communication (33%) and ease of use (31%). Items and reported ratings varied widely among instruments used, time points and geographical settings. Assessment of patient-reported quality measures through population- and facility-based surveys is present but heterogeneous in LAC countries. Satisfaction was measured frequently, although its use in accountability or informing quality improvement is limited. Measurement of healthcare quality in LAC needs to be more systematic, regular, comprehensive and to be led collaboratively by researchers, governments and policymakers to enable comparison of results across countries and to effectively inform policy implementation.",0.0
59,59,Development of a Quality-of-Life Instrument to Measure Current Health Outcomes: Health-Related Quality of Life with Six Domains (HRQ-6D),"M. Bujang, W. Lai, Selvasingam Ratnasingam",Journal of Clinical Medicine,2023,"Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is one of the most important outcome measures to be assessed by medical research. This study aims to develop and validate an instrument called the “health-related quality of life with six domains” (HRQ-6D), which aims to measure an individual’s health-related quality of life within a 24 h period of time. This is a questionnaire development study involving five phases, which are (i) to explore the subject matter content for gaining a better understanding of the topic, (ii) to develop the questionnaire, (iii) to assess both its content validity and face validity, (iv) to conduct a pilot study, and finally, (v) to undertake a field testing of the questionnaire. For the field-testing phase, a cross-sectional study involving a self-administered survey for HRQ-6D items was conducted among healthcare workers with various health conditions. Exploratory factor analysis was initially applied to construct the major dimensions of the HRQ-6D. Confirmatory factor analysis was subsequently applied to evaluate the model fit of the overall framework of the HRQ-6D. The clinical utility of this HRQ-6D was also assessed via its association with actual clinical evidence. A total of 406 respondents participated in the survey. Six domains were identified from the analysis, namely “pain”, “physical strength”, “emotion”, “self-care”, “mobility”, and “perception of future health” comprising two items in each domain. Each domain was reported to have a minimum value of Cronbach’s alpha of 0.731, and the model fit for the overall framework of the HRQ-6D was also found to be excellent. Exploratory factor analysis was undertaken for the 12 items of the HRQ-6D. All the domains can be categorized into three major dimensions, namely “health”, “body function”, and “future perception”, with a minimum value for their factor loadings of at least 0.507. A notable finding was that the HRQ-6D was significantly associated with an individual’s existing comorbidities and current status of health (p < 0.05). This study successfully validated the HRQ-6D, and we found it to possess both excellent levels of reliability and validity and a satisfactory degree of model fit; it was also significantly associated with actual clinical evidence.",0.026494523566515313

Evidence from Romania and Tajikistan and implications for global health,"Sophie Jullien, S. Carai · May 5, 202",Journal of Global Health,2023,"Quality of care is a key element of universal health coverage [1]. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines it as the degree to which health services increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes; health care should be effective, safe, people-centred, timely, equitable, integrated, and efficient [1,2]. Waste in health care is any activity that does not add value to patient care and should be avoided [2]. Hospitals have a long-standing major role in patient survival. However, hospitalisation can cause psychological, emotional, and physical distress, increase the risk of nosocomial infections, contribute to the disruption of work and education, and represent a considerable financial burden incurred both by patients and the health system [3]. In the WHO European Region, 10% of patients experience preventable harm or adverse events in hospitals [4]. Hospitalisation should therefore be limited to those who cannot be safely managed at the primary health care (PHC) level.",0.0

Belay",Frontiers in Public Health,2023,"Background Low-quality health care services are linked to a variety of health problems, which can have negative effects on adolescent and youth health. As a result, national data is crucial to providing high-quality healthcare to adolescents and youths in order to promote their health, wellness, and growth. Objective To examine the quality of young people's sexual and reproductive health care services and factors associated with service satisfaction in Ethiopia. Methods This review was carried out in accordance with the PRISMA guideline. We reviewed published data related to the quality of adolescent and youth-friendly sexual and reproductive health services (AYSRHS) in Ethiopia from January 02, 2002 to December 30, 2022. Relevant studies were identified through Google Scholar, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, and HINARI. The extracted data was imported into STATA version 14.0 software for analysis. Heterogeneity among the reported prevalence of studies was checked using χ2 and I2 tests. The publication bias was examined by Egger's correlation and Begg's regression intercept tests at a 5% significance level. Results The national pooled magnitude of structural, process, and output dimensions of quality of AYSRHS is 54.22% (95% CI: 33.21, 75.24%), 35.44% (95% CI: 24.95, 45.93%), and 57.01% (95% CI: 50.32, 63.7%), respectively. Being female (AOR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.14–2.27), employed (AOR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.06–3.14), waiting <30 min to get services (AOR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.69–4.31), and getting information on the availability of services (AOR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.15–2.11) were significantly associated with client satisfaction with AYSRHS. Conclusion The overall magnitude of quality of AYSRHS in the three dimensions is far below WHO quality standards, which are 75 percent for good quality. Sex, employment status, waiting time to get services, and information on the availability of services were significantly associated with client satisfaction with AYSRHS. Therefore, different stakeholders on different levels should work together to strengthen the quality of AYSRHS concidering the above factors.

62,62,Early Experience of the Quality Improvement Award Program in Federally Funded Health Centers.,"Janel L Jin, Josh Bolton, Robert S. Nocon",Health services research,2022,"OBJECTIVES
To describe the Health Resources and Services Administration's Quality Improvement Award (QIA) program, award patterns, and early lessons learned.


STUDY SETTING
1413 health centers eligible for QIA from 2014 to 2018.


STUDY DESIGN
We assessed cumulative QIA funding earned and modified funding excluding payments for per-patient bonuses, electronic health record (EHR) use, patient-centered medical home (PCMH) accreditation, and health information technology. We compared health centers on rural/urban location, PCMH accreditation, EHR reporting, and size.


DATA COLLECTION
Organizational and quality measures reported in the Uniform Data System, QIA program data.


PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
Average cumulative funding was higher for health centers that were not rural ($380,387 [± $233,467] vs $303,526 [± $164,272]), had PCMH accreditation ($401,675 [± $218,246] vs $250,784 [± $144,404]), used their EHR for quality reporting ($374,214 (± $222,866) vs $331,150 (± $198,689)), and were large ($435,473 (± $238,193) vs $270,681 (±$114,484) $231,917 (±$97,847) for small and medium centers, respectively). There were similar patterns, with smaller differences, for average modified payments.


CONCLUSIONS
QIA is an important feasible initiative to introduce value-based payment principles to health centers. Early lessons for program design include announcing award criteria in advance and focusing on a smaller number of priority targets.",0.036296096282048496

Evidence is needed on barriers and enablers of quality improvement initiatives. This systematic review sought to answer the question: What are the enablers of and barriers to quality improvement in primary health care in low- and middle-income countries? It adopted an integrative review approach with narrative evidence synthesis, which combined qualitative and mixed methods research studies systematically. Using a customized geographic search filter for LMICs developed by the Cochrane Collaboration, Scopus, Academic Search Ultimate, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PSYCHINFO, EMBASE, ProQuest Dissertations and Overton.io (a new database for LMIC literature) were searched in January and February 2023, as were selected websites and journals. 7,077 reports were retrieved. After removing duplicates, four reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, and performed quality appraisal and data extraction and synthesis. 50 reports from 47 studies were included, covering 52 LMIC settings. Six themes related to barriers and enablers of quality improvement were identified and organized using the model for understanding success in quality (MUSIQ) and the consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR). These were: microsystem of quality improvement, intervention attributes, implementing organization and team, health systems support and capacity, external environment and structural factors, and execution. Decision makers, practitioners, funders, implementers, and other stakeholders can use the evidence from this systematic review to minimize barriers and amplify enablers to better the chances that quality improvement initiatives will be successful in resource-limited settings.",0.0
64,64,Measuring Inconsistency in Quality Across Patient Groups to Target Quality Improvement,"D. Agniel, Steven C. Martino, Q. Burkhart",Medical Care,2022,"Background: Quality improvement (QI) may be aimed at improving care for all patients, or it may be targeted at only certain patient groups. Health care providers have little guidance when determining when targeted QI may be preferred. Objectives: The aim was to develop a method for quantifying performance inconsistency and guidelines for when inconsistency indicates targeted QI, which we apply to the performance of health plans for different patient groups. Research Design and Measures: Retrospective analysis of 7 Health Care Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measures of clinical care quality. Subjects: All Medicare Advantage (MA) beneficiaries eligible for any of 7 HEDIS measures 2015–2018. Results: MA plans with higher overall performance tended to be less inconsistent in their performance (r=−0.2) across groups defined by race-and-ethnicity and low-income status (ie, dual eligibility for Medicaid or receipt of Low-Income Subsidy). Plan characteristics were usually associated with only small differences in inconsistency. The characteristics associated with differences in consistency [eg, size, Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) status] were also associated with differences in overall performance. We identified 9 (of 363) plans that had large inconsistency in performance across groups (>0.8 SD) and investigated the reasons for inconsistency for 2 example plans. Conclusions: This newly developed inconsistency metric may help those designing and evaluating QI efforts to appropriately determine when targeted QI is preferred. It can be used in settings where performance varies across groups, which can be defined by patient characteristics, geographic areas, hospital wards, etc. Effectively targeting QI efforts is essential in today’s resource-constrained health care environment.",0.0

To describe what higher education and healthcare organisation partnerships can be identified in the published literature to teach pre-registration health professions students quality improvement and the impact of these partnerships.


BACKGROUND
Quality improvement has been gaining traction in the Western world and has been incorporated in varying degrees into the curricula for pre-registration health professions students. Providing quality improvement education in partnership with healthcare organisations has been found to be a valuable experiential learning solution, but the impacts of higher education and healthcare organisation partnerships have not been explored.


DESIGN AND METHODS
Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic review was undertaken using the Ovid MEDLINE, Emcare, CINAHL, Scopus and Eric databases. Studies were subject to quality appraisal using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program validated tools and a thematic analysis and narrative synthesis was undertaken.


RESULTS
Eight studies were included in this review. Features of existing quality improvement partnerships included experiential learning, time pressures and barriers to successful quality improvement partnerships. The impacts of quality improvement partnerships were demonstrated by an increase in quality improvement knowledge and understanding, students leading change and the implementation of quality improvement projects.


CONCLUSION
Several key elements were identified that may act as barriers or enablers to successful implementation of quality improvement partnerships. This review advances understandings of the need for a shift in focus that pays attention to the culture of teaching quality improvement in education partnerships and how this can be achieved in a mutually beneficial way.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
The development of quality improvement partnerships has been found to increase student knowledge and understanding, potentially improving patient outcomes, systems performance and professional development. More research is required on the establishment of quality improvement partnerships and the benefit these collaborations have on students, staff and patients.",0.0
66,66,Measurement of diet quality among First Nations peoples in Canada and associations with health: a scoping review.," · Jul 8, 202",Nutrition reviews,2023,"BACKGROUND
Given the increasing number and the diversity of dietary quality indices used for research, and the differences between settings, there is a need to identify valid indices of dietary quality in different contexts and populations and to identify their associations with health-related outcomes.


OBJECTIVES
The primary objective of this scoping review is to identify the tools used in determining dietary quality among First Nations and to describe the changes in diet. The second objective is to describe the associations identified in studies that have measured the relationship between health and dietary quality among First Nations; and the third objective is to identify factors associated with diet quality.


METHODS
PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Global Health, and Web of Science were searched from inception to June 2021 and updated in February 2022. Articles were included if the research subjects were First Nations, or if articles reported disaggregated subset data for First Nations. Eligible studies focused on nutrition and diet and were published in English or French.


RESULTS
A total of 151 articles were included in the analysis. Studies used several indicators to measure if individuals adhered to dietary guidelines. Traditional food consumption was frequently used as an indicator of diet quality (n = 96). The consumption of store-bought foods was used as an indicator in 28 studies. Some studies used other diet quality indicators such as the Healthy Eating Index (n = 5) and ultra-processed food ""NOVA"" classification (n = 6). A trend for decreasing traditional food intake over time was apparent, alongside an increase in store-bought food intake. This trend was accompanied with declining health status, including the increased prevalence of overweight and obesity, diabetes, metabolic diseases, and dental caries.


CONCLUSION
This scoping review showed that diet quality among First Nations is improved when traditional foods are consumed. Reduced diet quality was associated with increased risk of noncommunicable diseases.",0.0
67,67,"Health-Related Quality of Life in Children: The Roles of Age, Gender and Interpersonal Trust","Jing Wang, Wenji Jin, Liping Shi",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2022,"Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an interesting topic in health care sciences and psychology. Deeper insight into the internal mechanism of this effect through large samples is crucial to further understanding HRQoL and making targeted suggestions to improve HRQoL. The present study aims to investigate the mediating role of interpersonal trust between age and HRQoL from a developmental lens. The purpose of this study was to profile the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 generic scale in China and test the relationship between age and health-related quality of life, as well as the mediating role of interpersonal trust and the moderating role of gender. A sample of 6248 children completed measures of demography, health-related quality of life, and interpersonal trust. Regression analyses were performed to test the mediating role of interpersonal trust and the moderating role of gender. Age was associated with lower health-related quality of life and lower interpersonal trust. Similarly, gender differences were also noted, with boys reporting higher health-related quality of life and lower interpersonal trust than girls. Additionally, the health-related quality of life of girls declined more than that of boys with increasing age. Regression analyses revealed that age could predict decreased health-related quality of life via lower levels of interpersonal trust. What is more, the mediation effect was moderated by gender, with the observed mediation effect being stronger among boys than girls. The current study replicates age and gender differences in health-related quality of life and interpersonal trust. Moreover, this study explained how and when age affected the health-related quality of life of children, and provided a deeper understanding of the relation between age and health-related quality of life.",0.0

Health care workers are a vulnerable population to suffer alterations in the factors that affect life satisfaction. Determining the influence of these factors on quality of life is important for their proper management. Objective: To examine sociodemographic factors and healthy behaviors influencing life satisfaction in Peruvian professionals. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 506 health care workers, who had a mean age of 40.34 years (SD = 10.39). A sociodemographic questionnaire, sleep quality, physical activity, eating habits, and life satisfaction were used. A regression model was fitted with the life satisfaction variable as the dependent variable. Results: In multivariable analysis, age (β = −.938, P < .01) and perception of poor health status (β = −4.743, P < .001) were found to be associated with lower life satisfaction. On the other hand, higher university education level (β = 1.667, P < .001), absence of smoking (β = 3.202, P < .01), absence of depressive symptoms (β = 3.390, P < .001), interest in daily activities (β = 3.503, P < .05), good sleep quality (β = 1.027, P < .01), a high frequency of physical activity (β = 1.056, P < .01), and healthy eating are variables associated with higher life satisfaction. Conclusion: Sociodemographic aspects such as age and the perception of poor health are associated with lower life satisfaction. On the other hand, healthy behaviors such as absence of smoking, absence of depressive symptoms, interest in daily activities, good quality of sleep, high frequency of physical activity, and a healthy diet were associated with higher life satisfaction.",0.0

Abrams",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2023,"Abstract Objective We extended a 2013 literature review on electronic health record (EHR) data quality assessment approaches and tools to determine recent improvements or changes in EHR data quality assessment methodologies. Materials and Methods We completed a systematic review of PubMed articles from 2013 to April 2023 that discussed the quality assessment of EHR data. We screened and reviewed papers for the dimensions and methods defined in the original 2013 manuscript. We categorized papers as data quality outcomes of interest, tools, or opinion pieces. We abstracted and defined additional themes and methods though an iterative review process. Results We included 103 papers in the review, of which 73 were data quality outcomes of interest papers, 22 were tools, and 8 were opinion pieces. The most common dimension of data quality assessed was completeness, followed by correctness, concordance, plausibility, and currency. We abstracted conformance and bias as 2 additional dimensions of data quality and structural agreement as an additional methodology. Discussion There has been an increase in EHR data quality assessment publications since the original 2013 review. Consistent dimensions of EHR data quality continue to be assessed across applications. Despite consistent patterns of assessment, there still does not exist a standard approach for assessing EHR data quality. Conclusion Guidelines are needed for EHR data quality assessment to improve the efficiency, transparency, comparability, and interoperability of data quality assessment. These guidelines must be both scalable and flexible. Automation could be helpful in generalizing this process.",0.0
70,70,Scoping review of the association of plant-based diet quality with health outcomes,"R. Rosenfeld, Hailey M. Juszczak, Michele A. Wong · Aug 10, 202",Frontiers in Nutrition,2023,"Introduction The association of plant-based dietary patterns with health outcomes has traditionally been assessed without considering nutritional value. The plant-based dietary index (PDI), first published in 2016, overcomes this limitation with both a healthful PDI (hPDI) and an unhealthful PDI (uPDI), based on the quality of plant foods consumed plus the frequency of animal foods. We sought to summarize the breadth of research using the hPDI and uPDI to gain insight into how the quality of plant-based dietary patterns might be associated with health outcomes. Methods Scoping review of studies that used the PDI, hPDI, or uPDI to report associations with health outcomes. Multiple databases were searched from 2010 through April 2023 with 2 authors independently assessing eligibility and extracting data. In addition to assessing the association of the indices to health outcomes, we determined the frequency of concordant or discordant findings for hPDI versus PDI and for hPDI versus uPDI. Results We included 95 articles (54% longitudinal, 37% cross-sectional, and 9% case–control) with a median sample size of 3,646. Higher hPDI levels were associated with favorable health outcomes in 36% of comparisons (most often for obesity, mortality, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and psychiatric disorders), compared to 25% for the PDI and only 2% for the uPDI. Conversely, higher levels of the uPDI were associated with unfavorable health outcomes in 33% of comparisons, in contrast to under 1% for the hPDI and 2% for the PDI. When the hPDI association to an outcome was discordant with the uPDI or PDI, the significance and directionality always favored the hPDI over the uPDI, and nearly always favored the hPDI over the PDI. Discussion Dietary indices that account for the quality of plant foods can show health benefits that might be missed by a generic plant-based index. A greater focus on the quality of plant foods could improve nutrition guidelines, raise awareness about the benefits of adding unrefined plant foods to the diet, and empower consumers to make incremental additions of such foods to displace unhealthy foods. We anticipate increasing use of indices that address food quality in future research.",0.0
71,71,A Formal Framework For Incorporating Equity Into Health Care Quality Measurement.,"Denis Agniel, Irineo Cabreros, C. Damberg",Health affairs,2023,"Quality measurement is an important tool for incentivizing improvement in the quality of health care. Most quality measurement efforts do not explicitly target health equity. Although some measurement approaches may intend to realign incentives to focus quality improvement efforts on underserved groups, the extent to which they accomplish this goal is understudied. We posit that tying incentives to approaches on the basis of stratification or disparities may have unintended consequences or limited effects. Such approaches might not reduce existing disparities because addressing one aspect of equity may be in competition with addressing others. We propose equity weighting, a new measurement framework to advance equity on multiple fronts that addresses the shortcomings of existing approaches and explicitly calibrates incentives to align with equity goals. We use colorectal cancer screening data derived from 2017 Medicare claims to illustrate how equity weighting fixes unintended consequences in other methods and how it can be adapted to policy goals.",0.0
72,72,A systematic review of the association of diet quality with the mental health of university students: implications in health education practice,"S. Solomou, Jennifer Logue, S. Reilly",Health Education Research,2022,"Abstract University students are at risk of experiencing mental health problems during the transition from home to university. This transition can also adversely affect their diet quality. This review aims to examine bidirectional associations from observational studies regarding the influence of diet quality on the mental health of university students, and vice versa. The databases PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Library and Web of Science were searched using relevant search terms. The searches were last updated on 15 July 2022. Majority of studies (36 out of 45) found that good diet quality of students was associated with better mental health in terms of depression, anxiety, stress and overall general mental well-being. Moreover, majority of studies (19 out of 23) found that stress and anxiety of students were associated with poorer diet quality. The effect sizes observed were generally small–moderate. Healthy diets of students have been associated with better mental health in terms of depression, anxiety, stress or other mental health issues. Stress experienced by university students has been associated with unhealthy diets. There are implications for health education research, as interventions to improve diet quality at the university level could reduce mental health issues; additionally, interventions to support students under stress may lead to healthier dietary habits when living on campuses. Randomized controlled trials and intervention studies are needed to further investigate these implications.",0.0

Ziebolz · Mar 1, 202",Journal of Clinical Medicine,2022,"Objectives: Aim of this systematic review was to assess oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) of patients after stroke. Methods: The systematic literature search was performed on December 2021 based on PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus, with the search terms: “oral health-related quality of life” AND stroke OR apoplexy OR ischemic stroke OR apoplectic insult. Articles exclusively examining patients after stroke and reporting a well-documented and valid OHRQoL measurement were included. Results: Out of 68 findings, 8 studies were included. The number of patients ranged between 31 and 549 individuals, mean age between 55.7 and 73.9 years, and 49–72% of individuals were male. Two studies included a healthy control group. Oral health parameters were rarely reported across studies. Five studies reported on the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP) 14 for OHRQoL, showing means between 2.87 and 33.0 in sum score. Three studies applied Geriatric Oral Assessment Index (GOHAI), with sum scores between 45.6 and 55.0. Only one study found worse OHRQoL in stroke patients compared to healthy controls. Two studies reported on an association between OHRQoL and general quality of life. Three studies found OHRQoL to be associated with different oral health parameters. Only one study found OHRQoL to be associated with stroke-related parameters. Conclusions: Patients after stroke show a reduced OHRQoL. Medical staff and caregivers should support oral hygiene and dental visits, to foster patients’ oral health and OHRQoL.",0.031882786944324726
74,74,A co-creation roadmap towards sustainable quality of care: A multi-method study,"Fien Claessens, D. Seys, Jonas Brouwers",PLoS ONE,2022,"Objective Hospitals demonstrated increased efforts into quality improvement over the past years. Their growing commitment to quality combined with a heterogeneity in perceptions among healthcare stakeholders cause concerns on the sustainable incorporation of quality into the daily workflow. Questions are raised on the drivers for a sustainable hospital quality policy. We aimed to identify drivers and incorporate them into a new, unique roadmap towards sustainable quality of care in hospitals. Design A multi-method design guided by an eight-phase approach to develop a conceptual framework consists of multiple, iterative phases of data collection, synthesis and validation. Starting with a narrative review followed by a qualitative in-depth analysis and including feedback of national and international healthcare stakeholders. Setting Hospitals. Results The narrative review included 59 relevant papers focusing on quality improvement and the sustainability of these improved quality results. By integrating, synthesising and resynthesizing concepts during thematic and content analysis, the narrative review evolved to an integrated, co-creation roadmap. The Flanders Quality Model (FlaQuM) is presented as a driver diagram that features six primary drivers for a sustainable quality policy: (1) Quality Design and Planning, (2) Quality Control, (3) Quality Improvement, (4) Quality Leadership, (5) Quality Culture and (6) Quality Context. Six primary drivers are described in 19 building blocks (secondary drivers) and 104 evidence-based action fields. Conclusions The framework suggests that a manageable number of drivers, building blocks and action fields may support the sustainable incorporation of quality into the daily workflow. Therefore, FlaQuM can serve as a useful roadmap for future sustainable quality policies in hospitals and for future empirical and theoretical work in sustainable quality management.",0.0

76,76,A review of health—related quality of life issues in children suffering from certain key otolaryngological illnesses,"L. Chmielik, Grażyna Mielnik-Niedzielska, A. Kasprzyk",Frontiers in Pediatrics,2023,"Background The health—related quality of life (HRQoL) concept is nowadays increasingly and more broadly used for helping evaluate the effectiveness of medical treatment, superseding the earlier “quality of life” approach. The HRQoL concept likewise applies to otolaryngology and this narrative review study is focused on HRQoL outcomes in four key childhood otolaryngological diseases as reported in the literature. Study aim To retrospectively evaluate the literature on measuring HRQoL in children suffering from selected otolaryngological illnesses, during treatment. Materials and Methods Published studies/case reports were searched for in Medline, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and ORCID on the quality of life based on paediatric patient questionnaires, whether completed by subjects themselves or by their parents (by proxy). The following key words were used: health quality of life, otolaryngology/ENT, pediatrics/paediatrics. Studies before 1999 were omitted because hitherto, the “quality of life” had been imprecisely defined thus rendering any subsequent comparisions problematic. Results HRQoL scores and well-being were found to significantly deteriorate in child patients suffering from four important otolaryngological disorders: chronic sinusitis, nasal septum deviation, adenoid hypertrophy and hearing disease. The main problems found were infection, inflammation, disruption to family life and child-parental interaction, fitness-related issues, reduced ENT patencies and apnea. Conclusions The HRQoL appears to significantly deteriorate in children suffering from otolaryngological diseases. Further such studies are needed for other ENT diseases.",0.04113762719350416

78,78,What Quality of Care Means? Exploring Clinical Nurses’ Perceptions on the Concept of Quality Care: A Qualitative Study,"A. Stavropoulou, Michael Rovithis, M. Kelesi",Clinics and Practice,2022,"Quality is a multidimensional issue involving various features that depend on service performance and personal assessment. Clarifying the concept of quality is essential in order to further facilitate the understanding and improvement of quality in healthcare. The purpose of this study was to investigate how clinical nurses, providing care to adult medical patients, perceive and define the concept of quality nursing care. A descriptive qualitative research design was applied. A purposive sampling strategy was used to recruit nurses from the clinical sector of a general public hospital in Athens, Greece. Ten female nurses from the medical sector participated the study. Data collection was conducted through in-depth, semi-structured interviews. Conventional content analysis was used to analyze the verbatim data. Four categories were revealed from the data analysis, namely: (a) “Quality care is holistic care”, (b) “Good care is an interpersonal issue”, (c) “Leadership is crucial”, and (d) “Best care is our responsibility”. Quality care was defined as holistic care, addressing all patient needs with competency and aiming for the best patient outcomes. It was associated with communication, teamwork, good leadership, and personal commitment. By developing an in-depth and mutual understanding about what quality means, nurse leaders and practitioners may collaborate in finding common paths to support quality interventions and enhance quality nursing care in clinical practice.",0.09550974005577184
79,79,Impact of hospital accreditation on quality improvement in healthcare: A systematic review,"Mohammad J Alhawajreh, Audrey S Paterson, William J Jackson · Dec 5, 202",PLOS ONE,2023,"Objective This is the first systematic review aims to build the evidence for the impact of accreditation on quality improvement of healthcare services, as well as identify and develop an understanding of the contextual factors influencing accreditation implementation in the hospital setting through the lens of Normalisation Process Theory (NPT). Data sources Data were gathered from five databases; MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. And supplemental sources. Study design This systematic review is reported following PRISMA guidelines with a quality assessment. Data were analysed using a thematic analysis guided by the NPT theoretical framework. Data collection/extraction methods Data were extracted and summarized using prespecified inclusion/exclusion criteria and a data extraction sheet encompassing all necessary information about the studies included in the review. Principal findings There are inconsistent findings about the impact of accreditation on improving healthcare quality and outcomes, and there is scant evidence about its effectiveness. The findings also provide valuable insights into the key factors that may influence hospital accreditation implementation and develop a better understanding of their potential implications. Using the NPT shows a growing emphasis on the enactment work of the accreditation process and how this may drive improving the quality of healthcare services. However, little focus is given to accreditation’s effects on health professionals’ roles and responsibilities, strategies and ways for engaging health professionals for effective implementation, and ensuring that the goals and potential benefits of accreditation are made clear and transparent through ongoing evaluation and feedback to all health professionals involved in the accreditation process. Conclusions While there are contradictory findings about the impact of accreditation on improving the quality of healthcare services, accreditation continues to gain acceptance internationally as a quality assurance tool to support best practices in evaluating the quality outcomes of healthcare delivered. Policymakers, healthcare organisations, and researchers should proactively consider a set of key factors for the future implementation of accreditation programmes if they are to be effectively implemented and sustained within the hospital setting.

80,80,Model for building quality resilient health facility,"E. Otchi, Nhyira Gyawu, Gilbert Buckle · Dec 1, 202",Frontiers in Public Health,2023,"The AfIHQSA Model is the model for building quality resilient health systems. It is proposed as a compliment to and in many instances as an alternative to the many other existing in ensuring a systematic and a sustained approach to improving outcomes in African health systems. It seeks to bring the necessary transformation to healthcare quality and patient safety and facilitate the attainment of desired outcomes. The model is unique in its iterative nature and how it places premium on sustaining the gains of improvement. The authors are concerned about the lack of sustainability of the many quality improvement efforts on the continent and how they all fade out into obscurity upon the exit of the proponents. Six iterative steps are proposed in the use of the model and these are: leadership commitment and buy-in; situational analysis of quality management capacity; systems strengthening for quality management; quality improvement interventions for care outcomes; standardization/accreditation/certification; and iterative monitoring, evaluation of performance of interventions and learning. Most of the quality interventions and efforts on the continent have failed because the steps in this model have not been sufficiently followed and addressed. The required strengthening of the various components of the health system necessary to sufficiently bear the weight of any quality intervention and guarantee sustainability of the gains is often ignored. As authors, we have therefore formally adopted the use of this model and plan to further continue evaluating and monitoring its utility and its generalizability in different institutions and countries.",0.0

82,82,Mobile Health Apps for Breast Cancer: Content Analysis and Quality Assessment,"S. Yang, Cam Nhung Bui, Kyounghoon Park · Oct 14, 202",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,2022,"Background The number of mobile health apps is rapidly increasing. This means that consumers are faced with a bewildering array of choices, and finding the benefit of such apps may be challenging. The significant international burden of breast cancer (BC) and the potential of mobile health apps to improve medical and public health practices mean that such apps will likely be important because of their functionalities in daily life. As the app market has grown exponentially, several review studies have scrutinized cancer- or BC-related apps. However, those reviews concentrated on the availability of the apps and relied on user ratings to decide on app quality. To minimize subjectivity in quality assessment, quantitative methods to assess BC-related apps are required. Objective The purpose of this study is to analyze the content and quality of BC-related apps to provide useful information for end users and clinicians. Methods Based on a stepwise systematic approach, we analyzed apps related to BC, including those related to prevention, detection, treatment, and survivor support. We used the keywords “breast cancer” in English and Korean to identify commercially available apps in the Google Play and App Store. The apps were then independently evaluated by 2 investigators to determine their eligibility for inclusion. The content and quality of the apps were analyzed using objective frameworks and the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS), respectively. Results The initial search identified 1148 apps, 69 (6%) of which were included. Most BC-related apps provided information, and some recorded patient-generated health data, provided psychological support, and assisted with medication management. The Kendall coefficient of concordance between the raters was 0.91 (P<.001). The mean MARS score (range: 1-5) of the apps was 3.31 (SD 0.67; range: 1.94-4.53). Among the 5 individual dimensions, functionality had the highest mean score (4.37, SD 0.42) followed by aesthetics (3.74, SD 1.14). Apps that only provided information on BC prevention or management of its risk factors had lower MARS scores than those that recorded medical data or patient-generated health data. Apps that were developed >2 years ago, or by individuals, had significantly lower MARS scores compared to other apps (P<.001). Conclusions The quality of BC-related apps was generally acceptable according to the MARS, but the gaps between the highest- and lowest-rated apps were large. In addition, apps using personalized data were of higher quality than those merely giving related information, especially after treatment in the cancer care continuum. We also found that apps that had been updated within 1 year and developed by private companies had higher MARS scores. This may imply that there are criteria for end users and clinicians to help choose the right apps for better clinical outcomes.",0.03928076294275976
83,83,Quality of life among health care workers in Arab countries 2 years after COVID-19 pandemic,"R. Ghazy, Osman Abubakar Fiidow, F. Abdullah",Frontiers in Public Health,2022,"Background Assessment of the quality of life (QoL) among healthcare workers (HCWs) is vital for better healthcare and is an essential indicator for competent health service delivery. Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic strike, the frontline position of HCWs subjected them to tremendous mental and psychological burden with a high risk of virus acquisition. Aim This study evaluated the QoL and its influencing factors among HCWs residing in the Arab countries. Methods This was a cross-sectional study using a self-administered online questionnaire based on the World Health Organization QoL-BREF instrument with additional questions related to COVID-19. The study was conducted in three different languages (Arabic, English, and French) across 19 Arab countries between February 22 and March 24, 2022. Results A total of 3,170 HCWs were included in the survey. The majority were females (75.3%), aged 18–40 years (76.4%), urban residents (90.4%), married (54.5%), and were living in middle-income countries (72.0%). The mean scores of general health and general QoL were 3.7 ± 1.0 and 3.7 ± 0.9, respectively. Those who attained average physical, psychological, social, and environmental QoL were 40.8, 15.4, 26.2, and 22.3%, respectively. The income per capita and country income affected the mean scores of all QoL domains. Previous COVID-19 infection, having relatives who died of COVID-19, and being vaccinated against COVID-19 significantly affected the mean scores of different domains. Conclusion A large proportion of the Arab HCWs evaluated in this study had an overall poor QoL. More attention should be directed to this vulnerable group to ensure their productivity and service provision.",0.0

Cummings · Aug 24, 202",Medical Care Research and Review,2022,"Quality improvement (QI) work is critical, particularly in federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) that treat underserved populations. In a national sample of 45 FQHCs, we examined how patients’ sociodemographic characteristics were associated with employee engagement in QI, via innovation contests that solicited ideas for improving care and offered opportunities to vote on ideas. We posited that patients’ sociodemographic characteristics influence the complexity and intensity of clinical work and thus employees’ capacity to engage in QI. Regression results indicated that the percentage of patients living in poverty was negatively associated with employee participation in idea submission and voting. Moreover, the percentage of Hispanic patients was negatively associated with participation in voting. The percentage of Black patients, however, was not associated with either outcome. FQHCs that serve a higher share of low income and/or Hispanic patients may face resource and personnel constraints that reduce employees’ capacity to contribute to QI efforts.",0.0
85,85,Purchasing for high-quality care using National Health Insurance: evidence from Zambia,"Doris Afriyie Osei, F. Masiye, F. Tediosi",Health Policy and Planning,2023,"Abstract Improving the quality of care is essential for progress towards universal health coverage. Health financing arrangements offer opportunities for governments to incentivize and reward improvements in the quality of care provided. This study examines the extent to which the purchasing arrangements established within Zambia’s new National Health Insurance can improve equitable access to high-quality care. We adopt the Strategic Purchasing Progress and the Lancet Commission for High-Quality Health Systems frameworks to critically examine the broader health system and the purchasing dimensions of this insurance scheme and its implications for quality care. We reviewed policy documents and conducted 31 key-informant interviews with stakeholders at national, subnational and health facility levels. We find that the new health insurance could boost financial resources in higher levels of care, improve access to high-cost interventions, improve care experiences for its beneficiaries and integrate the public and private sectors. Our findings also suggest that health insurance will likely improve some aspects of structural quality but may not be able to influence process and outcome measures of quality. It is also not clear if health insurance will improve the efficiency of service delivery and whether the benefits realized will be distributed equitably. These potential limitations are attributable to the existing governance and financial challenges, low investments in primary care and shortcomings in the design and implementation of the purchasing arrangements of health insurance. Although Zambia has made progress in a short span, there is a need to improve its provider payment mechanisms, and monitoring and accounting for a higher quality of care.",0.0
86,86,How Is Quality of mHealth Interventions for Cancer Survivors Defined and Described? An Umbrella Review,"T. Tune, Shaun Goh, P. Williams",JCO Clinical Cancer Informatics,2022,"PURPOSE Although there are commonly accepted criteria of what defines quality of health care including cancer care, less is known about what defines quality of mHealth interventions in health care. The aim of this review was to identify how quality of mHealth interventions for cancer survivors is described and measured. METHODS CINAHL, EmCare, JBI, Medline, SCOPUS, and ProQuest databases from January 2008 to January 2020 were searched. Review papers with search terms related to mobile devices, quality, and cancer relevant to adults with cancer were included. Interventions needed to consist of mHealth technologies, such as mobile applications or short message service, or wearable devices. Title and abstract screening, full-text screening, and data extraction were performed independently by two reviewers. Conflicts were resolved by a third reviewer. Reviews were evaluated for coverage of quality according to six metrics defined by the Institute of Medicine: patient-centeredness, equitability, safety, effectiveness, timeliness, and efficiency. Any additional quality items were recorded. A Measurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) was used to rate the quality of the reviews included. RESULTS The initial search yielded 766 papers with seven systematic reviews meeting the eligibility criteria. Four papers were of AMSTAR moderate quality, with three of low quality. The median number of quality metrics reported in a review was two (the range was 1-4). Efficacy and safety and timeliness and efficiency were most reported (n = 4), followed by usability (n = 3), equitability and access (n = 2), privacy and security (n = 2), and patient-centeredness (n = 2). CONCLUSION There is great variability in how quality of mHealth interventions is defined with no reviews addressing all quality metrics. A comprehensive approach to measure quality of mHealth interventions is needed. Quality metrics of mHealth interventions for cancer survivors: variable and limited—standards needed",0.0
87,87,Exploring the Role of 6G Technology in Enhancing Quality of Experience for m-Health Multimedia Applications: A Comprehensive Survey,"Moustafa M. Nasralla, Sohaib Bin Altaf Khattak, I. Rehman","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,"Mobile-health (m-health) is described as the application of medical sensors and mobile computing to the healthcare provision. While 5G networks can support a variety of m-health services, applications such as telesurgery, holographic communications, and augmented/virtual reality are already emphasizing their limitations. These limitations apply to both the Quality of Service (QoS) and the Quality of Experience (QoE). However, 6G mobile networks are predicted to proliferate over the next decade in order to solve these limitations, enabling high QoS and QoE. Currently, academia and industry are concentrating their efforts on the 6G network, which is expected to be the next major game-changer in the telecom industry and will significantly impact all other related verticals. The exponential growth of m-health multimedia traffic (e.g., audio, video, and images) creates additional challenges for service providers in delivering a suitable QoE to their customers. As QoS is insufficient to represent the expectations of m-health end-users, the QoE of the services is critical. In recent years, QoE has attracted considerable attention and has established itself as a critical component of network service and operation evaluation. This article aims to provide the first thorough survey on a promising research subject that exists at the intersection of two well-established domains, i.e., QoE and m-health, and is driven by the continuing efforts to define 6G. This survey, in particular, creates a link between these two seemingly distinct domains by identifying and discussing the role of 6G in m-health applications from a QoE viewpoint. We start by exploring the vital role of QoE in m-health multimedia transmission. Moreover, we examine how m-health and QoE have evolved over the cellular network’s generations and then shed light on several critical 6G technologies that are projected to enable future m-health services and improve QoE, including reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, extended radio communications, terahertz communications, enormous ultra-reliable and low-latency communications, and blockchain. In contrast to earlier survey papers on the subject, we present an in-depth assessment of the functions of 6G in a variety of anticipated m-health applications via QoE. Multiple 6G-enabled m-health multimedia applications are reviewed, and various use cases are illustrated to demonstrate how 6G-enabled m-health applications are transforming human life. Finally, we discuss some of the intriguing research challenges associated with burgeoning multimedia m-health applications.",0.024036353435959956
88,88,Diet quality indexes for use during pregnancy: a scoping review.,"L. Robb, Gina Joubert, Corinna May Walsh · Oct 27, 202",Nutrition reviews,2023,"AIMS
High diet quality is related to better health outcomes in general. During pregnancy, a high-quality diet is of paramount importance to promote optimal maternal and neonatal outcomes. This is a scoping review of research available on diet quality indexes (DQIs) for use during pregnancy that summarizes the DQIs in terms of development, country of origin, population used, components, scoring and weighting of components, and evaluation. Furthermore, the DQIs are discussed narratively to inform and direct the development of improved and country-specific DQIs for pregnancy.


METHODS
The EBSCOhost database was used to identify English-language, peer-reviewed articles published between 2000 and 2023, from which 11 publications were identified that describe the development of pregnancy-specific DQIs. This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews model.


RESULTS
Almost all DQIs (n = 9 of 11) were developed in high-income countries, using dietary intake data from food frequency questionnaires. Several DQIs (n = 5 of 11) used the US Healthy Eating Index as basis and modified it in various ways. Almost all DQIs included both foods and nutrients as components (n = 9 of 11), with vegetables being the most commonly included component alone (n = 8 of 11) or combined with fruit (n = 2 of 11).


CONCLUSION
Because most DQIs were developed using dietary guidelines, recommendations, and dietary intake data from high-income countries, it is recommended that pregnancy-specific DQIs be developed and validated to reflect the nutrition guidelines for lower-income and culturally diverse countries.",0.0
89,89,"Health-related quality of life in high-cost, high-need populations.","L. Leininger, Marisa Tomaino, E. Meara · Jul 1, 202",The American journal of managed care,2023,"OBJECTIVES
To characterize patient-reported health and assess the psychometric performance of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in high-cost, high-need (HCHN) populations.


STUDY DESIGN
Retrospective longitudinal study examining health care utilization, expenditures, and patient-reported health comparing a baseline (year 1) and follow-up year (year 2).


METHODS
The sample includes adults (n = 46,934) participating in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey between 2011 and 2016. We estimated HRQOL for each sample member using the physical and mental health scales from the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 12. We compared HRQOL stratified by HCHN, defined as patients whose baseline (year 1) demographics, utilization, and clinical characteristics predicted top decile health spending in year 2. Analyses assessed the validity, reliability, and responsiveness of physical and, separately, mental health scales.


RESULTS
Among HCHN adults, the physical health scale exhibited robust measure validity, reliability, and responsiveness across all age groups; the mental health scale did not. Mean physical health was 1.25 SDs lower in HCHN vs other patients (37.9 vs 51.0 on a 0-100 scale increasing in self-perceived health; pooled SD, 10.5). Regressions indicated that a 0.5-SD increase in year 1 physical health among HCHN adults predicted a 5-percentage-point (10%) decrease in the probability of top decile health spending in year 2. In contrast to health care spending, HRQOL did not exhibit reversion to the mean in HCHN patients.


CONCLUSIONS
Patient-reported health outcomes remain poor in HCHN populations, even after health care utilization recedes. HRQOL is a promising outcome measure for HCHN-focused payment and delivery interventions.",0.0659835211319587

Lemos · Mar 18, 202",CoDAS,2022,"ABSTRACT Purpose Quality of life and self-perception of health are useful indicators for children and adolescents, as they are associated with objective and subjective states of health, including physical, cognitive, social, emotional, and environmental aspects. This study aims to characterize the adolescents at a Brazilian private financing school and to analyze the association between quality of life, health self-perception, and the sociodemographic profile. Methods This is a cross-sectional, observational study conducted with 124 elementary school students. The questionnaires of Characterization of the participants, Health Self-perception and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory ™ (PedsQL™) were applied to the adolescents and, to the parents or guardians, the Brazil Economic Classification Criteria questionnaires and PedsQLTM. Results The majority of the participants were female, belonged to economy class A, declared to have excellent health self-perception, and attributed a good score for their health. The majority of parents and adolescents evaluated positively the physical, psychosocial, and overall quality of life dimensions. Having a positive health self-perception increased the chances of having a good quality of life and the increase of one year in age decreased the chances of the adolescent having a positive quality of life assessment. Conclusion The study of adolescence is essential to broaden the understanding of aspects related to the quality of life, both in its physical and psychosocial dimension and to self-perception. This knowledge will provide adolescents with an incentive for their well-being, better performance of their activities, and greater preparation for adult life.",0.0

In this light, we aim to evaluate the development of primary health institutions between 2013, before the implementation of the hierarchical diagnosis and treatment system, and 2020 as well as people’s perception of the quality of primary healthcare services. Method: The national-level data (e.g., the numbers of primary health institutions, personnel, beds, visits, and hospitalizations) regarding primary health institutions were collected from the Health Statistics Yearbook, and the perceptions of the quality of primary healthcare services were collected by a web-based questionnaire survey using an internationally recognized assessment tool (i.e., PCAT-AE). In total, 10,850 persons were surveyed, and 10,419 participants were incorporated into the final analysis after removing invalid questionnaires. A descriptive statistical analysis (i.e., frequency and percentage) was used to analyze the national-level characteristics of primary health institutions and people’s perceptions of the quality of primary healthcare services. Moreover, a logistic regression model was used to analyze the factors influencing the perceptions of the quality of primary healthcare services. Results: From the macro perspective, the number of primary health institutions, beds, and personnel per 10 thousand residents slightly increased from 2013 to 2020, especially in the eastern and central areas. However, the average number of visits and the hospitalization rate in primary health institutions showed a decrease, especially in central and eastern areas. Among participants, 92.2% (9606/10,419) of them had previously sought healthcare services in primary health institutions, and most were seeking general outpatient services (57.06–63.45%), followed by medicine purchasing (16.49–21.51%), physical examinations (9.91–11.49%), preventive health services (5.11–6.48%), and hospitalization services (3.17–5.67%). The total perception scores on the quality of primary healthcare services reported by the participants were 26.19 and 27.00 for rural and urban areas, respectively, which accounted for 65.5% and 67.5% of the total score, respectively, and 26.62, 26.86, and 25.89 for the eastern, central, and western areas, respectively, with percentages of 66.6%, 67.2%, and 64.7%. The perception score on the quality among people contracted with a family doctor (29.83, 74.58%) was much higher than those who were not (25.25, 63.13%), and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Moreover, people who were female, married, had higher incomes, and were diagnosed with various diseases had better perceptions of the primary healthcare services compared to their counterparts (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Improvements were seen for primary health institutions, especially in terms of hardware resources such as beds and personnel. However, the service utilization in primary health institutions did not improve between 2013 and 2020. The perception score on the quality of primary healthcare was moderate to low in rural and urban as well as eastern, central, and western areas, but it was significantly higher among people contracted with a family doctor than those who were not. Therefore, it is important for policy makers to take or adjust measures focusing on quality improvement and increasing the service utilization in primary health institutions with good first contact, accessibility, continuity, comprehensiveness, and coordination, such as raising the enrollment rate of family doctors and promoting the provision of high-quality services.",0.0
92,92,Association between lifestyle behaviors and health-related quality of life among primary health care physicians in China: A cross-sectional study,"Yi-hao Lin, Yuankai Huang, Xiaoyu Xi · Mar 8, 202",Frontiers in Public Health,2023,"Background Primary health care (PHC) serves as the gatekeeper of health system and PHC physicians take on significant obligations to provide health care services in the pursuit of Universal Health Coverage (UHC). PHC physicians' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) can have a strong impact on patients, physicians and the health care system. Lifestyle interventions are found to be effective to improve HRQoL. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between lifestyle behaviors and HRQoL among PHC physicians, so that lifestyle intervention can be tailored by policy makers for health promotion. Methods A survey covering 31 provinces and administrative regions in China was conducted in 2020 using a stratified sampling strategy. Data on sociodemographic characteristics lifestyle behaviors and HRQoL were collected by a self-administered questionnaire. HRQoL was measured through EuroQol-five dimension-five level (EQ-5D-5L) instrument. A Tobit regression model was performed to evaluate the association between sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle behaviors and HRQoL. Results Among 894 PHC physicians who completed the survey, Anxiety/Depression (AD) was the dimension with the most problems reported (18.1%). Regular daily routine (β = 0.025, 95%CI 0.004 to 0.045) and good sleep quality (β = 0.049, 95% CI = 0.029 to 0.069) were protective factors for HRQoL, while smoking (β = −0.027, 95% CI = −0.079 to −0.003) and frequency of eating breakfast (β = −0.041, 95%CI = −0.079 to −0.003) were negatively associated with HRQoL. Physical activity and alcohol drinking were not significantly associated with HRQoL. Conclusion These findings suggest that tailored interventions on daily routine, improving sleep quality, and tobacco control among PHC physicians may be effective strategies to improve their HRQoL.",0.0
93,93,Quality improvement as a statement of values,"K. Eva · Dec 8, 202",Medical Education,2022,"‘By striving to constantly do better, what we do is we send a message about values’. When I heard those words, despite now forgetting who voiced them, I heard angels sing. What better description could there be for the community of health professional education scholars this journal exists to serve? The imperfect (or lack of) predictability that defines education as a complex adaptive system, combined with the ‘wicked’ nature of the problems with which we grapple, makes it such that perfection is likely unattainable. It is enough to engender cynicism, to make some give up, and to ensure others never even try. It is also, however, an opportunity to model the engagement with learning that we expect of our trainees as they grow into health professionals. We preach about lifelong learning, about the importance of growth mindset, about adaptive models of expertise, about never treating competence as something that can be achieved full stop. What do we actually display though when we set our education policies, do the exact same thing year in and year out and resist efforts to bring new ideas forward with a dismissive ‘we can't’? Feasibility must always be a consideration and large organisations with large stakes should not change for the sake of change. Nor should changes be made without first accumulating a reasonable degree of relevant evidence. There is always room, however, for each and every one of us to ‘strive to constantly do better’. Nothing guarantees that every such effort will realise ‘better’, but core messages we can send about the values we wish to promote for health professionals derive from the effort itself, a willingness to fail and the strength to adapt that this field has come to epitomise. We cannot even guarantee that everyone will have the same perspective regarding what ‘better’ looks like, let alone how to get there, but by staying engaged in the dialogue, we increase the likelihood that better argumentation and, hence, clearer pathways will emerge. It is that spirit of continuous quality improvement that serves as the inspiration behind this year's State of the Science issue in Medical Education. Spearheaded by Janet Grant, Danette McKinley and Jack Boulet, the papers address philosophical questions pertaining to how quality is defined as well as practical questions pertaining to what role regulation plays in quality improvement, how particular aspects of curriculum and competence might strive towards enhancement and what quality improvement looks like when considering issues of equity, diversity and inclusion. This, of course, is just a sampling of ways in which the overarching principle of quality improvement ‘sends a message about values’, none of which should be treated as the final word on the matters addressed; such a mentality, after all, would not exactly align with the notion of continuous quality improvement. Each paper, however, offers valuable reminders of the gains that can be made when we think in terms of how to collectively get better rather than how to justify the status quo. For that, I speak on behalf of the authors, guest editors and myself by thanking our reviewers for their role in improving the quality of these offerings and the field as a whole.",0.024314775722940597
94,94,Game-Theory-Inspired Novel Mechanism for Assessing Healthcare Quality,"T. Ahanger, Munish Bhatia, A. Aljumah · Dec 15, 202",IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022,"Healthcare is the most pivotal domain of every nation. With the sudden upraise of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a major concern for the healthcare industry to provide quality medical services to the common people. Vulnerable healthcare conditions have proven to be fatal for the patients. Conspicuously, it has become indispensable to assess the quality of healthcare services provided by the hospitals. The current article focuses on analyzing healthcare service quality delivered by the hospitals and healthcare centers. Specifically, the presented framework utilizes Internet of Things (IoT) technology to acquire real-time ambient data inside smart hospitals. The quantification of the healthcare service is performed using the Probability of Health Grade (PoHG) to classify data segments using the probabilistic Bayesian belief model. Furthermore, the temporal data abstraction is performed for the numerical analysis of healthcare service quality in terms of the health quality index (HQI). Finally, a 2-player game theory-inspired decision modeling is performed to analyze healthcare quality in a time-sensitive manner. The proposed framework is assessed using a simulated environment where 225325 data segments are analyzed. Results are compared with state-of-the-art techniques in which enhanced performance measures are registered in terms of classification efficacy (93.74%), decision-making efficiency [coefficient of determination (95%), accuracy (97.53%), mean square error (2.01%), and root mean square error (1.95%)], temporal delay (96.62 s), and reliability (91.58%).",0.041939725760614555
95,95,Factors Associated with Health-Related Quality of Life in Older Persons Residing in Nursing Homes,"A. Boström, T. Cederholm, G. Faxén-Irving",Journal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare,2022,"Purpose Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important patient-related outcome for the assessment of interventions and treatments in older people. Understanding underlying mechanisms for HRQoL is crucial for improving care, rehabilitation and symptom relief. This study examined the associations between HRQoL and frailty, sarcopenia, dependence of ADL, physical function and nutritional status in older nursing home (NH) residents. Patients and Methods This is a cross-sectional study employing baseline data from the Older Person’s Exercise and Nutrition (OPEN) study. Residents ≥75 years and able to stand up from seated position, residing in eight nursing homes in Sweden, were recruited. The EuroQoL 5-dimension Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L, 0–1) was used to assess HRQoL. For exposure, the FRAIL and SARC-F questionnaires, Bergs Balance Scale, Functional Independence Measure (FIM), and Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF) were used, including chair-stand test, walking speed and some biochemical markers. Descriptive and inferential statistics including linear regression models were applied. Results Data from 113 residents (59% women, mean age 85 years) revealed a mean EQ-5D index of 0.76. After relevant adjustments, factors associated with low HRQoL were sarcopenia (p<0.001), cognitive function (p<0.001), dependence in ADL (p=0.002), low plasma-albumin (p=0.002) and impaired nutritional status (p=0.038). Conclusion This study displays evidence that modifiable conditions like sarcopenia and malnutrition are related to HRQoL in older NH residents. Such findings indicate a potential for physical exercise, including muscle training, and improved nutritional routines, including protein supplementation, to enhance nursing home care. Future studies, in larger NH populations, on exercise and nutrition for effects on HRQoL are needed.",0.0
96,96,"Quality in Medical Imaging and Radiation Oncology: Why we should care about it, measure it and constantly improve it","S. Vinod, S. Goergen · Mar 1, 202",Journal of Medical Imaging and Radiation Oncology,2022,"There is no single agreed definition of quality in healthcare, in part because of the huge range of settings within which care is delivered. However, there is agreement that quality care can be characterized by several different but interrelated concepts. In 2001, the Institute of Medicine defined six dimensions of healthcare quality: safety, effectiveness and appropriateness, patientcenteredness, timeliness and accessibility, efficiency, and equitability. These domains continue to underpin international definitions, interpretations, and frameworks, including the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Healthcare’s three pillars of healthcare quality: patient centeredness, care that is driven by information, and care that is organized by safety. The National Quality Board in the U.K. has updated its “Shared Commitment to Quality” document in 2021, emphasizing the domains of safety, effectiveness, patient centeredness, and equitability as key pillars of its framework, but adding leadership and financial sustainability of service delivery to these pillars. New emphasis on digitally-enabled care, strategies to reduce the workload of emergency departments, and grow systems that support greater out-ofhospital care probably reflect at least, in part, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare delivery in the U.K. While we think we know what high-quality care looks and feels like in our daily work as healthcare professionals, this is actually highly contextual and more subjective than it appears, and may be viewed very differently by the community, patients and families, funders, health departments, and politicians. The practices of radiology and radiation oncology are the crossroads of multiple disciplines in healthcare, and radiology, in particular, spans the community– specialist care divide. Both specialties are highly technology-",0.0
97,97,The Effect of Health Literacy on Health-Related Quality of Life Among Saudi Women With Chronic Diseases,"E. Alhalal, Bayan Hadidi, Abeer Fouad Saad",Journal of Nursing Research,2023,"ABSTRACT Background Women have unique health concerns in the context of chronic illness. Although health literacy has been linked to health-related quality of life, the pathway by which some factors mediate this relationship has not been well examined among Saudi women with chronic disease. Purpose This study was designed to examine the relationship between health literacy and health-related quality of life and determine the mediating roles of healthy lifestyle and patient-centered care in explaining this relationship. Methods A cross-sectional study was used. A random sample of 20 primary healthcare centers in Saudi Arabia was selected. A convenience sample of 300 women diagnosed with a chronic illness was recruited from these centers. Structural equation modeling was used to test the proposed relationships. Results Controlling for women's age and education, the hypothesized model adequately fit the data. Health literacy and its dimensions were found to positively and directly affect both patient-centered care (β = 0.614, B = 0.189, p < .001) and healthy lifestyle behaviors (β = 0.550, B = 1.211, p < .001). Furthermore, both patient-centered care (β = 0.390, B = 1.301, p < .001) and healthy lifestyle behaviors (β = 0.322, B = 0.150, p < .001) were found to positively and directly affect health-related quality of life, whereas health literacy had significant, direct (β = 0.285, B = 0.292, p < .001) and indirect (β = 0.417, B = 0.428, p < .001) effects on health-related quality of life through patient-centered care and healthy lifestyle behaviors. Conclusions/Implications for Practice Special consideration should be given to health literacy, patient-centered care, and healthy lifestyle behaviors to enhance health-related quality of life in women with chronic illness. Gender-specific health services and interventions are needed to improve women's health literacy.",0.0
98,98,Investigating Employment Quality for Population Health and Health Equity: A Perspective of Power,"K. Fujishiro, Emily Q. Ahonen, Megan R. Winkler · Aug 1, 202",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2022,"Employment quality (EQ) has gained increasing attention as a determinant of health, but the debate among occupational health researchers over the measurement of EQ poses a challenge to advancing the literature. This is especially problematic when the concept is used across social, cultural, and national borders, as EQ is shaped by power dynamics within sociopolitical and economic contexts that are specific to each society. Investigating EQ in context could help develop a clearer understanding as to why EQ is configured in certain ways, how best EQ could be measured, how EQ impacts health, and ultimately how EQ could be improved. In this paper, we propose that attention to social context—and in particular power—may help advance the research on EQ and health. We present an allegory, or a visual description, that articulates the power balance in the employer–worker relation as well as in the sociopolitical context in which the employer–worker relation takes place. We end by proposing specific approaches for occupational health researchers to incorporate a perspective of power in EQ research that may clarify the concept and measurement of EQ. A clearer recognition of EQ as a product of power in social context aligns with the research approach of addressing work as a social structural determinant of health.",0.0
99,99,Out Of Reach: Inequities In The Use Of High-Quality Home Health Agencies,"Shekinah A Fashaw-Walters, Momotazur Rahman, G. Gee",Health affairs (Project Hope),2022,"Patients receiving home health services from high-quality home health agencies often experience fewer adverse outcomes (for example, hospitalizations) than patients receiving services from low-quality agencies. Using administrative data from 2016 and regression analysis, we examined individual- and neighborhood-level racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic factors associated with the use of high-quality home health agencies. We found that Black and Hispanic home health patients had a 2.2-percentage-point and a 2.5-percentage-point lower adjusted probability of high-quality agency use, respectively, compared with their White counterparts within the same neighborhoods. Low-income patients had a 1.2-percentage-point lower adjusted probability of high-quality agency use compared with their higher-income counterparts, whereas home health patients residing in neighborhoods with higher proportions of marginalized residents had a lower adjusted probability of high-quality agency use. Some 40–77 percent of the disparities in high-quality agency use were attributable to neighborhood-level factors. Ameliorating these inequities will require policies that dismantle structural and institutional barriers related to residential segregation.",0.0
