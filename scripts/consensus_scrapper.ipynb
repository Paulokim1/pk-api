It may be defined as a level of value provided by any health care resource, as determined by some measurement. Scientists use a variety of quality measures to attempt to determine health care quality. They use special indicators or based on a patients' or healthcare professional's perception. This article aims to provide a short review of the available data on the quality of healthcare services in selected European countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology The research was done by the use of online databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct. All the studies focused on the quality of healthcare services, yet the studies used different methods to measure this quality. In addition, the results of the authors' survey on the assessment of the quality of healthcare services before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were presented. Results Among twelve studies, four were from the United Kingdom and one each of Catalonia, Italy, Sweden, Poland, Netherlands, France, Germany, Belgium. Patients in the United Kingdom felt that the quality of services was good during the pandemic, whereas the quality declined in the other studies cited. The results of our research also revealed a decrease in the quality of healthcare services provided. Conclusions Nevertheless the development of telemedicine has had a positive impact on the quality of healthcare services. The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly affected most European countries' quality of healthcare services.\"},\n",

However, the existing studies still need a comprehensive review highlighting the vital machine, and Deep learning techniques for the automatic health information evaluation process. Objective Therefore, this study outlines the most recent developments and the current state of the art regarding evaluating the quality of online health information on web pages and specifies the direction of future research. Methods In this article, a systematic literature is conducted according to the PRISMA statement in eight online databases PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, ACM, Springer Link, Wiley Online Library, Emerald Insight, and Web of Science to identify all empirical studies that use machine and deep learning models for evaluating the online health information quality. Furthermore, the selected techniques are compared based on their characteristics, such as health quality criteria, quality measurement tools, algorithm type, and achieved performance. Results The included papers evaluate health information on web pages using over 100 quality criteria. The results show no universal quality dimensions used by health professionals and machine or deep learning practitioners while evaluating health information quality. In addition, the metrics used to assess the model performance are not the same as those used to evaluate human performance.

The data quality management process must ensure the reliability of collected data. Consequently, various methodologies to improve the quality of services are applied in the health field. At the same time, scientific research is constantly evolving to improve data quality through better reproducibility and empowerment of researchers and offers patient groups tools for secured data sharing and privacy compliance. Objective Through an integrative literature review, the aim of this work was to identify and evaluate digital health technology interventions designed to support the conducting of health research based on data quality. Methods A search was conducted in 6 electronic scientific databases in January 2022: PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Digital Library, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist and flowchart were used to visualize the search strategy results in the databases. Results After analyzing and extracting the outcomes of interest, 33 papers were included in the review. The studies covered the period of 2017-2021 and were conducted in 22 countries. Key findings revealed variability and a lack of consensus in assessing data quality domains and metrics. Data quality factors included the research environment, application time, and development steps. Strategies for improving data quality involved using business intelligence models, statistical analyses, data mining techniques, and qualitative approaches. Conclusions The main barriers to health data quality are technical, motivational, economical, political, legal, ethical, organizational, human resources, and methodological. The data quality process and techniques, from precollection to gathering, postcollection, and analysis, are critical for the final result of a study or the quality of processes and decision-making in a health care organization. The findings highlight the need for standardized practices and collaborative efforts to enhance data quality in health research.

The review is based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Literature searches were conducted in English (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Sciences) and German databases (BISp-Surf, BIBNET). All scores that considered health multidimensional on an individual level were included. Two independent reviewers screened and identified articles. The Quality assessment tool for studies with diverse design was used to assess study quality. Scores were recorded in a criteria grid to make their properties comparable, and the multidimensionality of the individual scores was evaluated using radar chart visualizations. Twenty-six studies met the inclusion criteria. Study quality was strong in eight, fair in twelve, and weak in six studies. Among the 26 studies, 21 different questionnaire-based scores were included, which all covered at least three of the five health dimensions (Five dimensions have been identified in a former literature research). Three scores covered all dimensions, but none covered all of the previously defined determinants. Thus, according to this works created definition (holistic = cover all dimensions with all determinants), no holistic health score exists, only multidimensional scores covering different dimensions and determinants. This review offers good comparability, as all the instruments were questionnaires, and could be used as a basis for future research.

However, the ability to effectively harness data has proven elusive, largely because of the quality of the data captured. Despite the importance of data quality (DQ), an agreed-upon DQ taxonomy evades literature. When consolidated frameworks are developed, the dimensions are often fragmented, without consideration of the interrelationships among the dimensions or their resultant impact. Objective The aim of this study was to develop a consolidated digital health DQ dimension and outcome (DQ-DO) framework to provide insights into 3 research questions: What are the dimensions of digital health DQ? How are the dimensions of digital health DQ related? and What are the impacts of digital health DQ? Methods Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, a developmental systematic literature review was conducted of peer-reviewed literature focusing on digital health DQ in predominately hospital settings. A total of 227 relevant articles were retrieved and inductively analyzed to identify digital health DQ dimensions and outcomes. The inductive analysis was performed through open coding, constant comparison, and card sorting with subject matter experts to identify digital health DQ dimensions and digital health DQ outcomes. Subsequently, a computer-assisted analysis was performed and verified by DQ experts to identify the interrelationships among the DQ dimensions and relationships between DQ dimensions and outcomes. The analysis resulted in the development of the DQ-DO framework. Results The digital health DQ-DO framework consists of 6 dimensions of DQ, namely accessibility, accuracy, completeness, consistency, contextual validity, and currency; interrelationships among the dimensions of digital health DQ, with consistency being the most influential dimension impacting all other digital health DQ dimensions; 5 digital health DQ outcomes, namely clinical, clinician, research-related, business process, and organizational outcomes; and relationships between the digital health DQ dimensions and DQ outcomes, with the consistency and accessibility dimensions impacting all DQ outcomes. Conclusions The DQ-DO framework developed in this study demonstrates the complexity of digital health DQ and the necessity for reducing digital health DQ issues. The framework further provides health care executives with holistic insights into DQ issues and resultant outcomes, which can help them prioritize which DQ-related problems to tackle first.'},\n",

Study selection The review included peer-reviewed and grey literature from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development listed countries that focused on quality of health student placements in regional, rural and remote areas. Data extraction Data were extracted regarding the methodological and design characteristics of each data source, and the features suggested to contribute to student placement quality under five categories based on a work-integrated learning framework. Results Of 2866 resulting papers, 101 were included for data charting and content analysis. The literature was dominated by medicine and nursing student placement research. No literature explicitly defined quality in rural health student placements, although proxy indicators for quality such as satisfaction, positive experiences, overall effectiveness and perceived value were identified. Content analysis resulted in four overarching domains pertaining to features of rural health student placement quality: (1) learning and teaching in a rural context, (2) rural student placement characteristics, (3) key relationships and (4) required infrastructure. Conclusion The findings suggest that quality in rural health student placements hinges on contextually specific features.

       "  'abstract': '© 2022 CMA Impact Inc. or its licensors CMAJ | February 28, 2022 | Volume 194 | Issue 8 E311 I n 2001, an influential report defined quality health care in terms of 6 domains: safety, effectiveness, timeliness, efficiency, patient-centredness and equity.1 Physicians primarily focus on effectiveness, which can be defined operationally as the degree to which patients receive the recommendations from practice guidelines relevant to their care. Only about 50% of patients receive such recommended care.2 In addition, patients frequently receive nonrecommended care and undergo tests and treatments with no clear benefits.3 In related research, Squires and colleagues provide contemporary estimates of these twin problems of underuse and overuse in Canada.4 Using Canadian data from 174 studies published from 2007 to 2021, they found a median proportion of inappropriate care (either underuse or overuse) of 30%. This inventory of shortfalls in the delivery of effective care comes after decades of efforts to address such quality problems,5 begging the question, “What should we be doing to deliver better quality care?” The mainstream approach to quality improvement — my professional focus for many years — aims to ensure that tests and treatments with established benefits are offered routinely to patients. Yet, efforts to promote the uptake of recommended care have produced few substantive successes. A systematic review of more than 100 interventions to improve professional practice that was published in CMAJ in 1995 concluded that “we have no magic bullets — most interventions achieved small to modest improvements in recommended practices.”6 More than 25 years later, promoting the uptake of effective interventions or de-implementing ineffective ones remains difficult. For instance, 2 common improvement interventions, computerized decision support and performance report cards, typically increase the proportion of patients receiving recommended care by just 5% overall according to the findings of 2 metaanalyses.7,8 Although some individual trials report larger improvements, the circumstances producing such results remain unclear. Even if worthwhile improvements could be generated consistently, overloading physicians with report cards and reminders for multiple different quality targets is unsustainable. The authors of the related systematic review4 identified glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) testing as the most frequently underused diagnostic test in Canada. Addressing underuse of HbA1c testing might prompt use of the many effective therapies for diabetes that have become available in recent years. Yet, more than 100 randomized controlled trials evaluating improvement interventions for outpatients with diabetes achieved an average reduction in HbA1c of just 0.37%.9 Although future research might identify more effective improvements, the question then becomes how to decide which quality problems to prioritize. This prioritization might depend on the anticipated health benefits from closing any particular shortfall in recommended care. Statins, the most frequent therapeutic example of underuse in the systematic review,4 provides a telling example. Among patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 33–100 must take a statin for 10 years to prevent 1 cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke or recurrent ischemic event.10 In addition, use of statins postpones death in patients with established atherosclerotic disease by just 17 days.11 Of course, clinical interventions with larger benefits exist — vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, for example — but they represent the Commentary Health services'},\n",

We conducted a scoping review of concepts and methods used to develop quality of healthcare indicators to better inform ongoing efforts towards a more harmonised approach to quality of care indicator development in global health. Methods We conducted a systematic search of electronic databases, grey literature and references for articles on developing quality of care indicators for routine monitoring in all healthcare settings and populations, published in English between 2010 and 2020. We used well-established methods for article screening and selection, data extraction and management. Results were summarised using a descriptive analysis and a narrative synthesis. Results The 221 selected articles were largely from high-income settings (89%), particularly the USA (46%), Canada (9%), UK (9%) and Europe (17%). Quality of care indicators were developed mainly for healthcare providers (56%), for benchmarking or quality assurance (37%) and quality improvement (29%), in hospitals (32%) and primary care (26%), across many diseases. The terms ‘quality indicator’ and ‘quality measure’ were the most frequently encountered terms (50% and 21%, respectively). Systematic approaches for quality of care indicator development emerged within national quality of care systems or through cross-country collaborations in high-income settings. Maternal, neonatal and child health (33%), mental health (26%) and primary care (57%) studies applied most components of systematic approaches, but not consistently or rigorously. Discussion The current evidence shows variations in concepts and approaches to developing quality of care indicators, with development and application mainly in high-income countries.

       "  'abstract': 'Quality of life (QoL) is closely linked to the health status of the individual. In turn, health status strongly depends on lifestyle. Health behavior, which is defined as the actions and attitudes of a person that affect their physical and mental health, is one of many lifestyle components. The nursing community, which is exposed to a range of dangers associated with the job position and responsibilities of the nursing profession, has to contend with several negative impacts. This results in a decreased quality of life among the nursing staff and reduced effectiveness in providing care services to patients. Methods: This study was conducted using an online Google questionnaire, which was completed by 312 nurses nationwide. The questionnaire included questions about the respondents’ socio-demographic survey and included the Health Behavior Inventory (HBI) by Juczyński and the WHOQoL-BREF questionnaire. Results: The mean QoL reported by respondents was 3.65 points (SD = 0.67), meaning that QoL ranked between good and average results. The respondents’ mean rating of their own health was 3.58 points (SD = 0.79), indicating that they rated their health status between satisfactory and average. Low health-behavior prevalence was reported by 139 of the 312 survey participants (44.55%), while 111 respondents (35.58%) had average health-behavior prevalence and 62 (19.87%) had high health-behavior prevalence. Each of the QoL domains correlated significantly (p ˂ 0.05) and positively (r ˃ 0) with the total HBI score and all its subscales. Conclusions: Higher quality of life improves the level of health behavior by nursing staff. Obesity lowers the quality of life in physical, psychological, and social domains. The psychological sphere was the best-rated quality of life domain by nurses. A good material situation for nurses has a positive effect on their quality of life.'},\n",

These steps include first, understanding existing disparities and, second, utilizing community engagement to ensure that QI enhances health equity. Before embarking on QI work, QI practitioners should first examine their metric of interest by patient characteristics, starting with race and ethnicity, language, and markers of access to care and socioeconomic status. Developing an understanding of existing disparities relevant to the QI project will ensure that the QI interventions can be designed to be most effective in the disadvantaged populations, thus increasing the likelihood that the intervention reduces existing disparities. In designing QI interventions, practitioners must also plan engagement with stakeholder populations ahead of time, to carefully understand their needs and priorities and how best to address them through QI efforts.'},\n",

Growing demand for telemedicine, mobile health apps, and advanced data analytics have further established their role in a modern information society during the Covid-19 crisis. Digital health is, in essence, powered by software (DHSW), which has to operate in the specific digital health environment characteristics and is therefore highly and intrinsically complex and prone to software defects and faults. Given the lack of standardization regarding DHSW quality, we explored the available reviewed research on this crucial topic in this brief paper, using a synthetic thematic analysis approach. We assert that neither the volume, distribution nor scope of the DHSW quality research content is satisfactory, and significant research gaps exist. Based on the presented evidence, we can only conclude that we should be concerned and that the time to act is now to ensure that the unavoidable increase of usage and prevalence of DHSW will not – in the end – reduce the quality of care due to subpar software and software-based digital health systems.'},\n",

The following tools were used to collect data: (a) the SERVQUAL questionnaire, which is designed to measure service quality through five dimensions, and (b) the Job Satisfaction Survey (JSS) questionnaire, which is designed to measure employees’ job satisfaction. Convenience sampling was used as a sampling technique. (3) Results: The level of internal quality service was found to be low as regards the dimensions of: reliability, assurance, responsiveness, and empathy, while the “tangibles” dimension was the only one which was assessed as having a satisfactory internal quality level. Τhe results also revealed a positive correlation between the job satisfaction subscales and the quality dimensions. Regarding demographic characteristics and their effect on employees’ perceptions of internal quality dimensions, the study found that the gender and the educational factor had no effect while younger employees have a more positive perception of the quality of responsiveness dimension in the health organizations where they work. In terms of profession, administrative staff had a lower perception of the quality of tangibles dimension than doctors and nurses. Concerning years of experience, the results indicated that employees with more previous working experience had a worse perception of the quality of reliability, responsiveness, and assurance dimensions.

Methods: We conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines. We searched seven databases for studies published between 2010 and August 2022. We included studies that evaluated the effects of health insurance on quality of care in LICs using randomized experiments or quasi-experimental study designs. Study outcomes were classified using the Donabedian framework. Results: We included 15 studies out of the 6,129 identified. Available evidence seems to suggest that health insurance has limited effects on structural quality, and its effects on the process of care remain mixed. At the population level, health insurance is linked to improved anthropometric measures for children and biomarkers such as blood pressure and hemoglobin levels. Conclusion: Based on the currently available evidence, it appears that health insurance in LICs has limited effects on the quality of care.

Web-based health information quality varies widely across websites and applications. It is critical to understand the factors that shape consumers’ evaluation of web-based health information quality and the role that it plays in their appraisal and use of health information and information systems. Objective This paper aimed to identify the antecedents and consequences of consumers’ evaluation of web-based health information quality as a means to consolidate the related research stream and to inform future studies on web-based health information quality. Methods We systematically searched 10 databases, examined reference lists, and conducted manual searches. Empirical studies that investigated consumers’ evaluation of web-based health information quality, credibility, or trust and their respective relationships with antecedents or consequences were included. Results We included 147 studies reported in 136 papers in the analysis. Among the antecedents of web-based health information quality, system navigability (ρ=0.56), aesthetics (ρ=0.49), and ease of understanding (ρ=0.49) had the strongest relationships with web-based health information quality. The strongest consequences of web-based health information quality were consumers’ intentions to use health information systems (ρ=0.58) and satisfaction with health information (ρ=0.46). Web-based health information quality relationships were moderated by numerous cultural dimensions, research designs, and publication moderators. Conclusions Consumers largely rely on peripheral cues and less on cues that require more information processing (eg, content comprehensiveness) to determine web-based health information quality. Surprisingly, the relationships between individual differences and web-based health information quality are trivial. Web-based health information quality has stronger effects on cognitive appraisals and behavioral intentions than on behavior. Despite efforts to include various moderators, a substantial amount of variance is still unexplained, indicating a need to study additional moderators. This meta-analysis provides broad and consistent evidence for web-based health information quality relationships that have been fractured and incongruent in empirical studies.'},\n",

Determining the quality of life of healthy people (health-related quality of life (HRQoL), considering the influence of various factors, is important due to the possibility of making subsequent comparative analyses regarding the quality of life of people diagnosed with diseases. In addition, it allows us to identify the most crucial factors influencing the HRQoL in the process of “good aging”. The purpose of the study was to present the HRQoL level of healthy people over 65 years of age. HRQoL was measured in five-year age groups (66–70, 71–75, 76–80, >80 years), considering the analyzed factors. Finally, 1038 healthy people were included in the study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: no diagnosed chronic diseases, no permanent treatment in specialist clinics, and no constant administration of medicaments. A comparative analysis was carried out, assuming a 5% conclusion error. The SF-36 questionnaire assessing the main dimensions of the quality of life was the tool used in the study to assess the HRQoL: the physical component summary (PCS), mental component summary (MCS) and index of life quality (ILQ). The factors significantly differentiating the average level of HRQoL were as follows: gender, place of residence, education, employment status, smoking and physical activity. Relationship status (p > 0.05) was one of the analyzed factors that did not influence the differences in the average level of the perceived HRQoL. More than a twofold greater chance of a higher HRQoL was reported in the group of men under 75 years of age (66–70: OR = 2.01; 71–75: OR = 2.52) compared to the group of women. The same relationship was noted in the case of higher education in respondents up to the age of 80 (66–70: OR = 1.56; 71–75: OR = 2.16; 76–80: OR = 2.74). Smoking by people over 80 years of age significantly increased the chances of a higher HRQoL in each of the dimensions (PCS: OR = 4.09; MCS: OR = 12.64; ILQ: OR = 5.79). Age as a non-modifiable factor significantly differentiates the level of the HRQoL of healthy people over 65 years of age. The results of the conducted study on HRQoL can be helpful when comparing the HRQoL of healthy people with a group of people with chronic diseases.'},\n",

Qualitative approaches are often based on fundamentally different values from (post)positivistempiricism, raising important considerations for quality, and whether qualitative work adheres to, and is judged by, appropriate publication standards. Thematic analysis (TA) has become a particularly popular method in qualitative health psychology, but poor practice is widespread. To support high quality, methodologically coherent TA practice and reporting, we critically reviewed 100 systematically selected papers reporting TA, published in five prominent health psychology journals. Our review assessed reported practice, and considered this in relation to methodological and quality recommendations. We identified 10 common areas of problematic practice in the reviewed papers, the majority citing reflexive TA. Considering the role of three ‘arbiters of quality’ in a peer review publication system – authors, reviewers, and editors – we developed 20 recommendations for authors, to support them in conducting and reporting high quality TA research, with associated questions for reviewers and editors to consider when evaluating TA manuscripts for publication. We end with considerations for facilitating better qualitative research, and enriching the understandings and knowledge base from which health psychology is practiced.'},\n",

Poor hospital financial health can precipitate closure, limiting patients’ access to care. Whether hospital quality is associated with financial health remains poorly understood. The objective of this study was to compare financial performance at high-quality and low-quality hospitals. Methods We performed a retrospective observational cohort study of U.S. hospitals using the American Hospital Association and Hospital Compare datasets for years 2013 to 2018. We used multilevel mixed-effects linear and logistic regression models with fixed year effects and random intercepts for hospitals to identify associations between hospitals’ measured quality outcomes—30-day hospital-wide readmission rate and the patient safety indicator-90 (PSI-90)—and their financial margins and risk of financial distress in the same year and the subsequent year. Our sample included 20,919 observations from 4,331 unique hospitals. Results In 2018, the median 30-day readmission rate was 15.2 (interquartile range [IQR] 14.8–15.6), the median PSI-90 score was 0.96 (IQR 0.89–1.07), the median operating margin was -1.8 (IQR -9.7–5.9), and 750 (22.7%) hospitals experienced financial distress. Hospitals in the best quintile of readmission rates experienced higher operating margins (+0.95%, 95% CI [0.51–1.39], p < .001) and lower odds of distress (odds ratio [OR] 0.56, 95% CI [0.45–0.70], p < .001) in the same year as compared to hospitals in the worst quintile. Hospitals in the best quintile of PSI-90 had higher operating margins (+0.62%, 95% CI [0.17–1.08], p = .007) and lower odds of financial distress (OR 0.70, 95% CI [0.55–0.89], p = .003) as compared to hospitals in the worst quintile. The results were qualitatively similar for the same-year and lag-year analyses. Conclusion Hospitals that deliver high-quality outcomes may experience superior financial performance compared to hospitals with poor-quality outcomes.'},\n",

A large number of quality indicators makes assessment of overall quality difficult, time consuming and impractical. There is consequently an increasing interest for composite measures based on a combination of multiple indicators. Objective To examine the use of different approaches to construct composite measures of quality of care and to assess the use of methodological considerations and justifications. Methods We conducted a literature search on PubMed and EMBASE databases (latest update 1 December 2020). For each publication, we extracted information on the weighting and aggregation methodology that had been used to construct composite indicator(s). Results A total of 2711 publications were identified of which 145 were included after a screening process. Opportunity scoring with equal weights was the most used approach (86/145, 59%) followed by all-or-none scoring (48/145, 33%). Other approaches regarding aggregation or weighting of individual indicators were used in 32 publications (22%). The rationale for selecting a specific type of composite measure was reported in 36 publications (25%), whereas 22 papers (15%) addressed limitations regarding the composite measure. Conclusion Opportunity scoring and all-or-none scoring are the most frequently used approaches when constructing composite measures of quality of care. The attention towards the rationale and limitations of the composite measures appears low.

       "  'abstract': \"Health care quality is important. The World Health Organization defines health care quality as “the degree to which health services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes” (1). Thus, care must be both effective and broadly delivered. Quality measures and metrics help clinicians understand how we are doing and what we need to improve (2). However, although the adage “if you measure it, it gets done” is often true, it ignores the question of whether “it” is worth measuring at all. Extensive research addresses health care quality. Frameworks describe quality at the patient, provider, system, and societal levels, and via interpersonal and technical domains; frameworks also describe how measures can evaluate structures, processes, and outcomes (3–6). They include criteria such as feasibility, usability, importance, and scientific soundness. Pragmatic health care quality metrics would benefit from considering some concepts common in the business world, such as timeliness, strategy, and ownership (7, 8). In their article, Wisse and colleagues report a study that evaluates cancer screening quality with a common procedure: colonoscopy to follow a positive fecal immunochemical test (FIT) result in the Netherlands' screening program (9). It is useful to evaluate this example considering quality concepts from both the health care and business worlds. The Netherlands' colorectal cancer screening program has used impressive, evidence-based practices throughout its existence, including modeling to estimate risk, benefit, and person-power. The quality metric evaluated is the adenoma detection rate (ADR)—the percentage of colonoscopy examinations for a FIT-positive indication performed by a given endoscopist in which a precancerous polyp (that is, an adenoma) is detected. The outcome is postcolonoscopy risk for cancer. The quality of the colonoscopic examinations in the program is high: endoscopists' ADRs range between 40% and 82% with a median of 67%. Higher ADRs are strongly associated with lower patient risks for subsequent cancer (10). Even within this high range, likely from the higher-risk FIT-positive population, the associations are remarkably consistent with prior evaluations of lower-risk screening colonoscopies: every 1% increase in ADR is associated with a 4% to 5% reduction in the risk for postcolonoscopy cancers (10). These seemingly small ADR differences are deceptive—if an endoscopist increases their ADR by just 10%, their patients' associated decrease in relative interval cancer risk is a remarkable 40% to 50%. And this estimate is likely conservative, given the study excluded some cancers, and modeling studies suggest that, over a lifetime, higher ADRs are associated with even greater cancer prevention. This study provides an excellent framework for evaluating 9 concepts regarding effective quality metrics and how these can illustrate pathways for meaningful metrics for the care of other cancers and disorders. This is crucial, as metrics can be laboriously implemented without improving outcomes. Trustworthy: There is a clear, standard, transparent, reproducible, and accurate method for calculating and reporting the metric. Wisse and colleagues demonstrate trustworthiness in the use of clear definitions for adenoma detection, interval cancer, and other measures. Important: Leaders and clinicians who receive feedback must know the quality measure is clinically meaningful and, thus, important. Compelling observational data have reproducibly associated endoscopist ADR with meaningful differences in patient outcomes. Strategic: A strategic metric's development starts with the clinical goal in mind and then likely causal factors are identified, rather than using process measures of unclear importance. It also aligns with global organizational strategies. Here, the outcome is important (postcolonoscopy cancers and associated deaths), the metric itself is causally associated (identification of precancerous polyps for removal), and these are closely aligned with the screening program's strategic goals (decreasing cancer deaths). Relevant: The targets and methods should be applicable for the local setting. This is the key unique aspect of Wisse and colleagues' study. The consensus ADR standards created for colonoscopy screening programs were not relevant for the Netherlands' FIT-based program as most colonoscopies were for higher-risk FIT-positive patients. The investigators are to be commended for recognizing and using a relevant metric for their setting. Actionable: Effort should only be expended on measuring things that result in actions that improve outcomes. For example, inspection time during colonoscopy or “withdrawal time” has been proposed as a metric, but interventions solely focused on this measure did not consistently improve polyp detection or cancer prevention. In contrast, improvements in adenoma detection have been associated with improved subsequent cancer risk. Simple: Metrics should be straightforward to calculate, to understand, and to associate with the strategic goal. Complex mathematical models or multiple measures may impede adoption and obfuscate interventions. Incentives, if provided, should be clear, achievable, and timely. Conceptually, adenoma detection is simple to calculate, though, in some settings, the lack of electronic pathology or indication data impedes its use. However, Wisse and colleagues demonstrate that ADR is feasible to calculate. Gaming-resistant: Ideally, metrics should be calculated independent of the entity being evaluated. In the current example, neither the colonoscopy indication (FIT positivity) nor the pathology result (presence of adenoma on biopsy) is determined by the endoscopist. Time-stamped: The provision of recent data and feedback at regular intervals is needed to inform actionable\"},\n",

Cancer patients exhibit a wide range of signs and symptoms. Being diagnosed with cancer has a variety of consequences that can affect one’s quality of life. The term \"health-related quality of life\" refers to a multidimensional concept that encompasses a person’s whole health. The availability of data on the prevalence of poor quality of life among cancer patients in Ethiopia is critical in order to focus on early detection and enhance cancer treatment strategies. In Ethiopia, however, there is a scarcity of information. As a result, the aim of this study was to determine the pooled estimated prevalence of quality of life among cancer patients in Ethiopia. Materials and methods This systematic review and meta-analysis were searched through MEDLINE, Pub Med, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar by using different search terms on the prevalence of health-related quality of life of cancer patients and Ethiopia. Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument was used for critical appraisal of studies. The analysis was done using STATA 14 software. The Cochran Q test and I2 test statistics were used to test the heterogeneity of studies. The funnel plot and Egger’s test were used to show the publication bias. The pooled prevalence of health-related quality of life of cancer with a 95% confidence interval was presented using forest plots. Results A total of 12 studies with 3, 479 participants were included in this review and the overall pooled estimates mean score of health-related quality of life among cancer patients in Ethiopia was 57.91(44.55, 71.27, I2 = 98.8%, p≤0.001). Average monthly income (AOR:3.70;95%CI:1.31,6.10), Stage of cancer (AOR:4.92;95% CI:2.96,6.87), Physical functioning(AOR:4.11;95%CI:1.53,6.69), Social functioning(AOR:3.91;95% CI:1.68,6.14) were significantly associated with quality of life. Subgroup meta-analysis of health-related quality of life of cancer patients in Ethiopia done by region showed that a higher in Addis Ababa 83.64(78.69, 88.60), and lower in SNNP region16.22 (11.73, 20.71), and subgroup analysis done based on the type of cancer showed that higher prevalence of health-related quality of life among cancer patients was breast cancer 83.64(78.69, 88.60). Conclusion This review showed that the overall health related quality of life was above an average. Furthermore, average monthly income, cancer stage, physical, and social functioning were all significant determinants in cancer patients’ QOL.as a result, this review suggests that quality of life evaluation be incorporated into a patient’s treatment routine, with a focus on linked components and domains, as it is a critical tool for avoiding and combating the effects of cancer and considerably improving overall health.

To examine how these strategies have been shaped in different jurisdictions, we carried out this study. We conducted a web-based comparative study of international practices. We first defined seven key health care and services quality management functions. We then drew on the experience of authors to make a reasoned selection of 13 countries or states across the world. We determined the distance that separates each of these functions from a country's Ministry of Health (MoH); and examined whether these functions are concentrated in a single organisation or dispersed across several organisations. Afterwards, we correlated our results with the quality level of these countries based on the OECD's health care indicators. Overall, Netherlands, Québec (Canada), Korea, Germany, England (UK), and the United States had at least 50% of their quality management functions controlled by self-regulated organisations. The Market Concentration Index ranged from 937 for the United States to 6800 for Russia. Graphical representation has shown us two health system models. Our results also clearly showed that countries had a better quality of care most often when they belong to model 1 of our taxonomy. These findings will help countries design and implement large-scale health care and services quality strategies for better and safer health care and services.\"},\n",

This study aimed to investigate the association between diet quality and health-related quality of life, and to explore the differences in diet quality and health-related quality of life between gender and parental education status. In this cross-sectional study, a detailed web-based recall method was implemented to determine dietary intake, which was analysed using the newly developed Swedish Healthy Eating Index for Adolescents 2015 (SHEIA15) and the Riksmaten Adolescents Diet Diversity Score (RADDS), to determine diet quality. The KIDSCREEN-10 questionnaire was used to measure health-related quality of life, and parental education was self-reported through questionnaires. Parental education was divided into two groups: ≤12 years or >12 years. The study included 1139 adolescents from grade 7 (13–14 years old), 51% were girls. The results showed that girls had higher scores for healthy eating and diet diversity but lower scores for health-related quality of life. A positive association was found between diet diversity and health-related quality of life (Adj R2 = 0.072, p = 0.001), between vegetable/fruit consumption and health-related quality of life (Adj R2 = 0.071, p = 0.002), and between healthy eating and diet diversity (Adj R2 = 0.214, p < 0.001). No association was found between healthy eating and health-related quality of life for all participants. The mean scores for healthy eating and diet diversity were significantly higher in the higher education parental group. In conclusion, higher diet diversity and increased fruit and vegetable consumption could be a strategy to improve health-related quality of life among adolescents. There is a need to promote better diet quality, especially in households of low parental education.

In the following, Germany’s performance is analysed in terms of quality of care. Methods Indicators to assess the dimension of quality of care were selected based on a systematic search of established instruments in national and international HSPA initiatives. Other criteria for the inclusion of indicators were data availability and international comparability. The indicators were evaluated in terms of their time trend (2000-2020) and in international comparison (e.g., Austria, Denmark, France). Results Overall, 17 indicators were selected to assess quality of care, of which two could not be analysed due to missing data. Indicators include, e.g., emergency readmissions after hospital stays, patient-reported medical errors, coercive measures in psychiatric wards, and in-hospital mortality.

Results: A total of 96 reports were identified and submitted to a preliminary screening selection. As a result of the pre-screening stage, 64 papers were qualified to further evaluation. The output of the evaluation brought 15 reported studies, meeting the pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria. The total number of participants was 5903 (ranging from 20 to 439 in individual reports), and 54% of them were women. Eight studies (53%) were from Iran, two from Pakistan (13%) and one each from Arabia, Malaysia, South Korea, Bangladesh, and Iraq (each-about 7%). The results showed gaps between patients’ expectations and perceptions in all five dimensions of Servqual in almost each analysed study. The highest and lowest values of the gaps in quality scores were associated with the dimensions of reliability, tangibility, empathy, and responsiveness, respectively. Conclusions: The study demonstrated that the method of Servqual is broadly used in various medical sectors to assess the quality of medical services provided. In addition, the study demonstrated that patients had significantly higher expectations of the medical services offered in the five dimensions studied. The results, obtained through the Servqual method, may help improve and monitor the quality of services provided by different institutions.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Hospital quality has been measured and made publicly available for decades in the US and for more than a decade in Germany, as part of an effort to help those countries achieve quality improvement. The German hospital market presents a unique opportunity to examine the relationship between public reporting and quality improvement in the absence of performance-linked payment incentives in a high-income country. We considered quality indicators from several important categories of health services provided in hospitals (hip, knee, obstetrics, neonatology, heart, neck artery surgery, pressure ulcers, and pneumonia), using structured hospital quality reports from the period 2012-19. Our findings support the idea that public reporting provides a quality benchmark and prevents the provision of very low quality health care services, suggesting that imposing financial punishment on low performers is not necessary and may hinder quality improvement and aggravate health disparities. Although hospitals' intrinsic motivation and market forces play roles in improving quality, they are not sufficient to maintain the quality of high-performing hospitals. Therefore, in addition to rewarding high-performing institutions, aligning quality incentives with the intrinsic professional values of clinical care may be useful in achieving quality improvement.\"},\n",

With the ongoing evolution of oncology and the promising potential of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) to enhance cancer patient outcomes, an exceptional opportunity for improving health emerges. Despite significant progress in grasping disease progression and treatment efficacy, an urgent need persists in harnessing HRQoL’s power [2]. Actively gathering “non-clinical” information from cancer survivors during various stages of diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship allows health-care professionals to obtain crucial insights into factors affecting patient outcomes [3]. Employing this approach, clinicians can more effectively customize treatments to address individual patient requirements, ultimately boosting the overall QoL for those with cancer. Consequently, it is essential to acknowledge HRQoL’s significance and capitalize on these factors’ opportunities for advancement.'},\n",

Quality improvement (QI) is the combined and unceasing efforts of all in this space – clinicians, administrators, patients and others – to uphold this focus and make changes that produce better system performance and patient outcomes. Here, we introduce relevant definitions, methodologies and ethics for clinicians new to QI. The manufacturing industry has been credited with establishing the formal mechanisms we now recognise as QI. In the 1920s, statistician and mathematician Walter Shewhart described four sequential steps performed iteratively to better control manufacturing outputs: Plan, Do, Check/Study and Act. Deming, Juran and Ishikawa tailored the approach to Japanese manufacturing after World War II to reduce undesirable variability, improve production quality and lower costs. Similar methods were thereafter adopted across diverse industries, including healthcare, albeit sporadically prior to the 1980s. Forms of QI have existed in medicine for many centuries, including Florence Nightingale’s pioneering efforts in infection control. Progressive engagement with patients as stakeholders in their own care, and recognition that healthcare organisations and clinicians have a responsibility to improve the quality of care, have led to proliferation of QI initiatives. Ongoing investment in healthcare quality has generated numerous government and nongovernment QI agencies in support.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background Health-related quality of life metrics evaluate treatments in ways that matter to patients, so are often included in randomised clinical trials (hereafter trials). Multimorbidity, where individuals have 2 or more conditions, is negatively associated with quality of life. However, whether multimorbidity predicts change over time or modifies treatment effects for quality of life is unknown. Therefore, clinicians and guideline developers are uncertain about the applicability of trial findings to people with multimorbidity. We examined whether comorbidity count (higher counts indicating greater multimorbidity) (i) is associated with quality of life at baseline; (ii) predicts change in quality of life over time; and/or (iii) modifies treatment effects on quality of life. Methods and findings Included trials were registered on the United States trials registry for selected index medical conditions and drug classes, phase 2/3, 3 or 4, had ≥300 participants, a nonrestrictive upper age limit, and were available on 1 of 2 trial repositories on 21 November 2016 and 18 May 2018, respectively. Of 124 meeting these criteria, 56 trials (33,421 participants, 16 index conditions, and 23 drug classes) collected a generic quality of life outcome measure (35 EuroQol-5 dimension (EQ-5D), 31 36-item short form survey (SF-36) with 10 collecting both). Blinding and completeness of follow up were examined for each trial. Using trials where individual participant data (IPD) was available from 2 repositories, a comorbidity count was calculated from medical history and/or prescriptions data. Linear regressions were fitted for the association between comorbidity count and (i) quality of life at baseline; (ii) change in quality of life during trial follow up; and (iii) treatment effects on quality of life. These results were then combined in Bayesian linear models. Posterior samples were summarised via the mean, 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles as credible intervals (95% CI) and via the proportion with values less than 0 as the probability (PBayes) of a negative association. All results are in standardised units (obtained by dividing the EQ-5D/SF-36 estimates by published population standard deviations). Per additional comorbidity, adjusting for age and sex, across all index conditions and treatment comparisons, comorbidity count was associated with lower quality of life at baseline and with a decline in quality of life over time (EQ-5D −0.02 [95% CI −0.03 to −0.01], PBayes > 0.999). Associations were similar, but with wider 95% CIs crossing the null for SF-36-PCS and SF-36-MCS (−0.05 [−0.10 to 0.01], PBayes = 0.956 and −0.05 [−0.10 to 0.01], PBayes = 0.966, respectively). Importantly, there was no evidence of any interaction between comorbidity count and treatment efficacy for either EQ-5D or SF-36 (EQ-5D −0.0035 [95% CI −0.0153 to −0.0065], PBayes = 0.746; SF-36-MCS (−0.0111 [95% CI −0.0647 to 0.0416], PBayes = 0.70 and SF-36-PCS −0.0092 [95% CI −0.0758 to 0.0476], PBayes = 0.631. Conclusions Treatment effects on quality of life did not differ by multimorbidity (measured via a comorbidity count) at baseline—for the medical conditions studied, types and severity of comorbidities and level of quality of life at baseline, suggesting that evidence from clinical trials is likely to be applicable to settings with (at least modestly) higher levels of comorbidity.

However, improving the health information quality of mHealth platforms is still a problem that needs to be studied and solved in order to make the platforms sustainable. Based on the reputation mechanism, this study creates a behavioral evolutionary game model for health information providers (physicians) and managers (mHealth platforms), explores the evolution process and evolutionarily stable strategy of the behaviors in various situations, and uses numerical simulation technology to analyze mHealth platforms' constraints and the influencing factors of health information quality. This study presents three key findings. First, considering reputation, health information managers and mHealth platform providers should not unilaterally optimize health information. Instead, mHealth platforms should have active quality control, and physician groups should provide high-quality health information, which is the ideal evolution of the model. Second, the rewards that physicians receive from patients and mHealth platforms for providing quality health information, the reputation benefits, the penalties that physicians suffer for providing low-quality health information, and the increased probability and cost of rent-seeking behavior that physicians may choose can effectively promote the choice of physicians to provide high-quality health information. Third, the reputation gain of mHealth platforms, the probability of mHealth platforms being exposed, and increased losses suffered from exposure can effectively promote the choice of mHealth platforms to control the quality of health information. This study can provide a theoretical basis for mHealth platforms' health information quality control, which is conducive to the healthy and sustainable development of mHealth platforms and the improvement of user satisfaction.\"},\n",

Furthermore, accurate measurement of population perspectives is vital to hold health systems accountable and to inform improvement efforts. To describe the current state of such measures in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), we conducted a systematic review of facility and population-based assessments that included patient-reported experience and satisfaction measures. Five databases were searched for publications on quantitative surveys assessing healthcare quality in Spanish- or Portuguese-speaking LAC countries, focusing on the domains of processes of care and quality impacts. We included articles published since 2011 with a national sampling frame or inclusion of multiple subnational regions. We tabulated and described these articles, identifying, classifying and summarizing the items used to assess healthcare quality into the domains mentioned earlier. Of the 5584 publications reviewed, 58 articles met our inclusion criteria. Most studies were cross-sectional (95%), assessed all levels of healthcare (57%) and were secondary analyses of existing surveys (86%). The articles yielded 33 unique surveys spanning 12 LAC countries; only eight of them are regularly administered surveys. The most common quality domains assessed were satisfaction (in 33 out of 58 articles, 57%), evidence-based/effective care (34%), waiting times (33%), clear communication (33%) and ease of use (31%). Items and reported ratings varied widely among instruments used, time points and geographical settings. Assessment of patient-reported quality measures through population- and facility-based surveys is present but heterogeneous in LAC countries. Satisfaction was measured frequently, although its use in accountability or informing quality improvement is limited. Measurement of healthcare quality in LAC needs to be more systematic, regular, comprehensive and to be led collaboratively by researchers, governments and policymakers to enable comparison of results across countries and to effectively inform policy implementation.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is one of the most important outcome measures to be assessed by medical research. This study aims to develop and validate an instrument called the “health-related quality of life with six domains” (HRQ-6D), which aims to measure an individual’s health-related quality of life within a 24 h period of time. This is a questionnaire development study involving five phases, which are (i) to explore the subject matter content for gaining a better understanding of the topic, (ii) to develop the questionnaire, (iii) to assess both its content validity and face validity, (iv) to conduct a pilot study, and finally, (v) to undertake a field testing of the questionnaire. For the field-testing phase, a cross-sectional study involving a self-administered survey for HRQ-6D items was conducted among healthcare workers with various health conditions. Exploratory factor analysis was initially applied to construct the major dimensions of the HRQ-6D. Confirmatory factor analysis was subsequently applied to evaluate the model fit of the overall framework of the HRQ-6D. The clinical utility of this HRQ-6D was also assessed via its association with actual clinical evidence. A total of 406 respondents participated in the survey. Six domains were identified from the analysis, namely “pain”, “physical strength”, “emotion”, “self-care”, “mobility”, and “perception of future health” comprising two items in each domain. Each domain was reported to have a minimum value of Cronbach’s alpha of 0.731, and the model fit for the overall framework of the HRQ-6D was also found to be excellent. Exploratory factor analysis was undertaken for the 12 items of the HRQ-6D. All the domains can be categorized into three major dimensions, namely “health”, “body function”, and “future perception”, with a minimum value for their factor loadings of at least 0.507. A notable finding was that the HRQ-6D was significantly associated with an individual’s existing comorbidities and current status of health (p < 0.05). This study successfully validated the HRQ-6D, and we found it to possess both excellent levels of reliability and validity and a satisfactory degree of model fit; it was also significantly associated with actual clinical evidence.'},\n",

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines it as the degree to which health services increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes; health care should be effective, safe, people-centred, timely, equitable, integrated, and efficient [1,2]. Waste in health care is any activity that does not add value to patient care and should be avoided [2]. Hospitals have a long-standing major role in patient survival. However, hospitalisation can cause psychological, emotional, and physical distress, increase the risk of nosocomial infections, contribute to the disruption of work and education, and represent a considerable financial burden incurred both by patients and the health system [3]. In the WHO European Region, 10% of patients experience preventable harm or adverse events in hospitals [4].

As a result, national data is crucial to providing high-quality healthcare to adolescents and youths in order to promote their health, wellness, and growth. Objective To examine the quality of young people's sexual and reproductive health care services and factors associated with service satisfaction in Ethiopia. Methods This review was carried out in accordance with the PRISMA guideline. We reviewed published data related to the quality of adolescent and youth-friendly sexual and reproductive health services (AYSRHS) in Ethiopia from January 02, 2002 to December 30, 2022. Relevant studies were identified through Google Scholar, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, and HINARI. The extracted data was imported into STATA version 14.0 software for analysis. Heterogeneity among the reported prevalence of studies was checked using χ2 and I2 tests. The publication bias was examined by Egger's correlation and Begg's regression intercept tests at a 5% significance level. Results The national pooled magnitude of structural, process, and output dimensions of quality of AYSRHS is 54.22% (95% CI: 33.21, 75.24%), 35.44% (95% CI: 24.95, 45.93%), and 57.01% (95% CI: 50.32, 63.7%), respectively. Being female (AOR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.14–2.27), employed (AOR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.06–3.14), waiting <30 min to get services (AOR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.69–4.31), and getting information on the availability of services (AOR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.15–2.11) were significantly associated with client satisfaction with AYSRHS. Conclusion The overall magnitude of quality of AYSRHS in the three dimensions is far below WHO quality standards, which are 75 percent for good quality. Sex, employment status, waiting time to get services, and information on the availability of services were significantly associated with client satisfaction with AYSRHS. Therefore, different stakeholders on different levels should work together to strengthen the quality of AYSRHS concidering the above factors.

Evidence is needed on barriers and enablers of quality improvement initiatives. This systematic review sought to answer the question: What are the enablers of and barriers to quality improvement in primary health care in low- and middle-income countries? It adopted an integrative review approach with narrative evidence synthesis, which combined qualitative and mixed methods research studies systematically. Using a customized geographic search filter for LMICs developed by the Cochrane Collaboration, Scopus, Academic Search Ultimate, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PSYCHINFO, EMBASE, ProQuest Dissertations and Overton.io (a new database for LMIC literature) were searched in January and February 2023, as were selected websites and journals. 7,077 reports were retrieved. After removing duplicates, four reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, and performed quality appraisal and data extraction and synthesis. 50 reports from 47 studies were included, covering 52 LMIC settings. Six themes related to barriers and enablers of quality improvement were identified and organized using the model for understanding success in quality (MUSIQ) and the consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR). These were: microsystem of quality improvement, intervention attributes, implementing organization and team, health systems support and capacity, external environment and structural factors, and execution. Decision makers, practitioners, funders, implementers, and other stakeholders can use the evidence from this systematic review to minimize barriers and amplify enablers to better the chances that quality improvement initiatives will be successful in resource-limited settings.'},\n",

Health care providers have little guidance when determining when targeted QI may be preferred. Objectives: The aim was to develop a method for quantifying performance inconsistency and guidelines for when inconsistency indicates targeted QI, which we apply to the performance of health plans for different patient groups. Research Design and Measures: Retrospective analysis of 7 Health Care Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measures of clinical care quality. Subjects: All Medicare Advantage (MA) beneficiaries eligible for any of 7 HEDIS measures 2015–2018. Results: MA plans with higher overall performance tended to be less inconsistent in their performance (r=−0.2) across groups defined by race-and-ethnicity and low-income status (ie, dual eligibility for Medicaid or receipt of Low-Income Subsidy). Plan characteristics were usually associated with only small differences in inconsistency. The characteristics associated with differences in consistency [eg, size, Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) status] were also associated with differences in overall performance. We identified 9 (of 363) plans that had large inconsistency in performance across groups (>0.8 SD) and investigated the reasons for inconsistency for 2 example plans. Conclusions: This newly developed inconsistency metric may help those designing and evaluating QI efforts to appropriately determine when targeted QI is preferred. It can be used in settings where performance varies across groups, which can be defined by patient characteristics, geographic areas, hospital wards, etc. Effectively targeting QI efforts is essential in today’s resource-constrained health care environment.'},\n",

The purpose of this study was to profile the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 generic scale in China and test the relationship between age and health-related quality of life, as well as the mediating role of interpersonal trust and the moderating role of gender. A sample of 6248 children completed measures of demography, health-related quality of life, and interpersonal trust. Regression analyses were performed to test the mediating role of interpersonal trust and the moderating role of gender. Age was associated with lower health-related quality of life and lower interpersonal trust. Similarly, gender differences were also noted, with boys reporting higher health-related quality of life and lower interpersonal trust than girls. Additionally, the health-related quality of life of girls declined more than that of boys with increasing age. Regression analyses revealed that age could predict decreased health-related quality of life via lower levels of interpersonal trust. What is more, the mediation effect was moderated by gender, with the observed mediation effect being stronger among boys than girls. The current study replicates age and gender differences in health-related quality of life and interpersonal trust. Moreover, this study explained how and when age affected the health-related quality of life of children, and provided a deeper understanding of the relation between age and health-related quality of life.'},\n",

We abstracted and defined additional themes and methods though an iterative review process. Results We included 103 papers in the review, of which 73 were data quality outcomes of interest papers, 22 were tools, and 8 were opinion pieces. The most common dimension of data quality assessed was completeness, followed by correctness, concordance, plausibility, and currency. We abstracted conformance and bias as 2 additional dimensions of data quality and structural agreement as an additional methodology. Discussion There has been an increase in EHR data quality assessment publications since the original 2013 review. Consistent dimensions of EHR data quality continue to be assessed across applications. Despite consistent patterns of assessment, there still does not exist a standard approach for assessing EHR data quality. Conclusion Guidelines are needed for EHR data quality assessment to improve the efficiency, transparency, comparability, and interoperability of data quality assessment. These guidelines must be both scalable and flexible. Automation could be helpful in generalizing this process.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Introduction The association of plant-based dietary patterns with health outcomes has traditionally been assessed without considering nutritional value. The plant-based dietary index (PDI), first published in 2016, overcomes this limitation with both a healthful PDI (hPDI) and an unhealthful PDI (uPDI), based on the quality of plant foods consumed plus the frequency of animal foods. We sought to summarize the breadth of research using the hPDI and uPDI to gain insight into how the quality of plant-based dietary patterns might be associated with health outcomes. Methods Scoping review of studies that used the PDI, hPDI, or uPDI to report associations with health outcomes. Multiple databases were searched from 2010 through April 2023 with 2 authors independently assessing eligibility and extracting data. In addition to assessing the association of the indices to health outcomes, we determined the frequency of concordant or discordant findings for hPDI versus PDI and for hPDI versus uPDI. Results We included 95 articles (54% longitudinal, 37% cross-sectional, and 9% case–control) with a median sample size of 3,646. Higher hPDI levels were associated with favorable health outcomes in 36% of comparisons (most often for obesity, mortality, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and psychiatric disorders), compared to 25% for the PDI and only 2% for the uPDI. Conversely, higher levels of the uPDI were associated with unfavorable health outcomes in 33% of comparisons, in contrast to under 1% for the hPDI and 2% for the PDI. When the hPDI association to an outcome was discordant with the uPDI or PDI, the significance and directionality always favored the hPDI over the uPDI, and nearly always favored the hPDI over the PDI. Discussion Dietary indices that account for the quality of plant foods can show health benefits that might be missed by a generic plant-based index. A greater focus on the quality of plant foods could improve nutrition guidelines, raise awareness about the benefits of adding unrefined plant foods to the diet, and empower consumers to make incremental additions of such foods to displace unhealthy foods. We anticipate increasing use of indices that address food quality in future research.'},\n",

We posit that tying incentives to approaches on the basis of stratification or disparities may have unintended consequences or limited effects. Such approaches might not reduce existing disparities because addressing one aspect of equity may be in competition with addressing others. We propose equity weighting, a new measurement framework to advance equity on multiple fronts that addresses the shortcomings of existing approaches and explicitly calibrates incentives to align with equity goals.

This review aims to examine bidirectional associations from observational studies regarding the influence of diet quality on the mental health of university students, and vice versa. The databases PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Library and Web of Science were searched using relevant search terms. The searches were last updated on 15 July 2022. Majority of studies (36 out of 45) found that good diet quality of students was associated with better mental health in terms of depression, anxiety, stress and overall general mental well-being. Moreover, majority of studies (19 out of 23) found that stress and anxiety of students were associated with poorer diet quality. The effect sizes observed were generally small–moderate. Healthy diets of students have been associated with better mental health in terms of depression, anxiety, stress or other mental health issues. Stress experienced by university students has been associated with unhealthy diets. There are implications for health education research, as interventions to improve diet quality at the university level could reduce mental health issues; additionally, interventions to support students under stress may lead to healthier dietary habits when living on campuses.

Their growing commitment to quality combined with a heterogeneity in perceptions among healthcare stakeholders cause concerns on the sustainable incorporation of quality into the daily workflow. Questions are raised on the drivers for a sustainable hospital quality policy. We aimed to identify drivers and incorporate them into a new, unique roadmap towards sustainable quality of care in hospitals. Design A multi-method design guided by an eight-phase approach to develop a conceptual framework consists of multiple, iterative phases of data collection, synthesis and validation. Starting with a narrative review followed by a qualitative in-depth analysis and including feedback of national and international healthcare stakeholders. Setting Hospitals. Results The narrative review included 59 relevant papers focusing on quality improvement and the sustainability of these improved quality results. By integrating, synthesising and resynthesizing concepts during thematic and content analysis, the narrative review evolved to an integrated, co-creation roadmap. The Flanders Quality Model (FlaQuM) is presented as a driver diagram that features six primary drivers for a sustainable quality policy: (1) Quality Design and Planning, (2) Quality Control, (3) Quality Improvement, (4) Quality Leadership, (5) Quality Culture and (6) Quality Context. Six primary drivers are described in 19 building blocks (secondary drivers) and 104 evidence-based action fields. Conclusions The framework suggests that a manageable number of drivers, building blocks and action fields may support the sustainable incorporation of quality into the daily workflow. Therefore, FlaQuM can serve as a useful roadmap for future sustainable quality policies in hospitals and for future empirical and theoretical work in sustainable quality management.'},\n",

The HRQoL concept likewise applies to otolaryngology and this narrative review study is focused on HRQoL outcomes in four key childhood otolaryngological diseases as reported in the literature. Study aim To retrospectively evaluate the literature on measuring HRQoL in children suffering from selected otolaryngological illnesses, during treatment. Materials and Methods Published studies/case reports were searched for in Medline, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and ORCID on the quality of life based on paediatric patient questionnaires, whether completed by subjects themselves or by their parents (by proxy). The following key words were used: health quality of life, otolaryngology/ENT, pediatrics/paediatrics. Studies before 1999 were omitted because hitherto, the “quality of life” had been imprecisely defined thus rendering any subsequent comparisions problematic. Results HRQoL scores and well-being were found to significantly deteriorate in child patients suffering from four important otolaryngological disorders: chronic sinusitis, nasal septum deviation, adenoid hypertrophy and hearing disease. The main problems found were infection, inflammation, disruption to family life and child-parental interaction, fitness-related issues, reduced ENT patencies and apnea. Conclusions The HRQoL appears to significantly deteriorate in children suffering from otolaryngological diseases. Further such studies are needed for other ENT diseases.'},\n",

Clarifying the concept of quality is essential in order to further facilitate the understanding and improvement of quality in healthcare. The purpose of this study was to investigate how clinical nurses, providing care to adult medical patients, perceive and define the concept of quality nursing care. A descriptive qualitative research design was applied. A purposive sampling strategy was used to recruit nurses from the clinical sector of a general public hospital in Athens, Greece. Ten female nurses from the medical sector participated the study. Data collection was conducted through in-depth, semi-structured interviews. Conventional content analysis was used to analyze the verbatim data. Four categories were revealed from the data analysis, namely: (a) “Quality care is holistic care”, (b) “Good care is an interpersonal issue”, (c) “Leadership is crucial”, and (d) “Best care is our responsibility”. Quality care was defined as holistic care, addressing all patient needs with competency and aiming for the best patient outcomes. It was associated with communication, teamwork, good leadership, and personal commitment. By developing an in-depth and mutual understanding about what quality means, nurse leaders and practitioners may collaborate in finding common paths to support quality interventions and enhance quality nursing care in clinical practice.'},\n",

Data sources Data were gathered from five databases; MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. And supplemental sources. Study design This systematic review is reported following PRISMA guidelines with a quality assessment. Data were analysed using a thematic analysis guided by the NPT theoretical framework. Data collection/extraction methods Data were extracted and summarized using prespecified inclusion/exclusion criteria and a data extraction sheet encompassing all necessary information about the studies included in the review. Principal findings There are inconsistent findings about the impact of accreditation on improving healthcare quality and outcomes, and there is scant evidence about its effectiveness. The findings also provide valuable insights into the key factors that may influence hospital accreditation implementation and develop a better understanding of their potential implications. Using the NPT shows a growing emphasis on the enactment work of the accreditation process and how this may drive improving the quality of healthcare services. However, little focus is given to accreditation’s effects on health professionals’ roles and responsibilities, strategies and ways for engaging health professionals for effective implementation, and ensuring that the goals and potential benefits of accreditation are made clear and transparent through ongoing evaluation and feedback to all health professionals involved in the accreditation process. Conclusions While there are contradictory findings about the impact of accreditation on improving the quality of healthcare services, accreditation continues to gain acceptance internationally as a quality assurance tool to support best practices in evaluating the quality outcomes of healthcare delivered. Policymakers, healthcare organisations, and researchers should proactively consider a set of key factors for the future implementation of accreditation programmes if they are to be effectively implemented and sustained within the hospital setting.

It is proposed as a compliment to and in many instances as an alternative to the many other existing in ensuring a systematic and a sustained approach to improving outcomes in African health systems. It seeks to bring the necessary transformation to healthcare quality and patient safety and facilitate the attainment of desired outcomes. The model is unique in its iterative nature and how it places premium on sustaining the gains of improvement. The authors are concerned about the lack of sustainability of the many quality improvement efforts on the continent and how they all fade out into obscurity upon the exit of the proponents. Six iterative steps are proposed in the use of the model and these are: leadership commitment and buy-in; situational analysis of quality management capacity; systems strengthening for quality management; quality improvement interventions for care outcomes; standardization/accreditation/certification; and iterative monitoring, evaluation of performance of interventions and learning. Most of the quality interventions and efforts on the continent have failed because the steps in this model have not been sufficiently followed and addressed. The required strengthening of the various components of the health system necessary to sufficiently bear the weight of any quality intervention and guarantee sustainability of the gains is often ignored. As authors, we have therefore formally adopted the use of this model and plan to further continue evaluating and monitoring its utility and its generalizability in different institutions and countries.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background The number of mobile health apps is rapidly increasing. This means that consumers are faced with a bewildering array of choices, and finding the benefit of such apps may be challenging. The significant international burden of breast cancer (BC) and the potential of mobile health apps to improve medical and public health practices mean that such apps will likely be important because of their functionalities in daily life. As the app market has grown exponentially, several review studies have scrutinized cancer- or BC-related apps. However, those reviews concentrated on the availability of the apps and relied on user ratings to decide on app quality. To minimize subjectivity in quality assessment, quantitative methods to assess BC-related apps are required. Objective The purpose of this study is to analyze the content and quality of BC-related apps to provide useful information for end users and clinicians. Methods Based on a stepwise systematic approach, we analyzed apps related to BC, including those related to prevention, detection, treatment, and survivor support. We used the keywords “breast cancer” in English and Korean to identify commercially available apps in the Google Play and App Store. The apps were then independently evaluated by 2 investigators to determine their eligibility for inclusion. The content and quality of the apps were analyzed using objective frameworks and the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS), respectively. Results The initial search identified 1148 apps, 69 (6%) of which were included. Most BC-related apps provided information, and some recorded patient-generated health data, provided psychological support, and assisted with medication management. The Kendall coefficient of concordance between the raters was 0.91 (P<.001). The mean MARS score (range: 1-5) of the apps was 3.31 (SD 0.67; range: 1.94-4.53). Among the 5 individual dimensions, functionality had the highest mean score (4.37, SD 0.42) followed by aesthetics (3.74, SD 1.14). Apps that only provided information on BC prevention or management of its risk factors had lower MARS scores than those that recorded medical data or patient-generated health data. Apps that were developed >2 years ago, or by individuals, had significantly lower MARS scores compared to other apps (P<.001). Conclusions The quality of BC-related apps was generally acceptable according to the MARS, but the gaps between the highest- and lowest-rated apps were large. In addition, apps using personalized data were of higher quality than those merely giving related information, especially after treatment in the cancer care continuum. We also found that apps that had been updated within 1 year and developed by private companies had higher MARS scores. This may imply that there are criteria for end users and clinicians to help choose the right apps for better clinical outcomes.'},\n",

Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic strike, the frontline position of HCWs subjected them to tremendous mental and psychological burden with a high risk of virus acquisition. Aim This study evaluated the QoL and its influencing factors among HCWs residing in the Arab countries. Methods This was a cross-sectional study using a self-administered online questionnaire based on the World Health Organization QoL-BREF instrument with additional questions related to COVID-19. The study was conducted in three different languages (Arabic, English, and French) across 19 Arab countries between February 22 and March 24, 2022. Results A total of 3,170 HCWs were included in the survey. The majority were females (75.3%), aged 18–40 years (76.4%), urban residents (90.4%), married (54.5%), and were living in middle-income countries (72.0%). The mean scores of general health and general QoL were 3.7 ± 1.0 and 3.7 ± 0.9, respectively. Those who attained average physical, psychological, social, and environmental QoL were 40.8, 15.4, 26.2, and 22.3%, respectively. The income per capita and country income affected the mean scores of all QoL domains. Previous COVID-19 infection, having relatives who died of COVID-19, and being vaccinated against COVID-19 significantly affected the mean scores of different domains. Conclusion A large proportion of the Arab HCWs evaluated in this study had an overall poor QoL. More attention should be directed to this vulnerable group to ensure their productivity and service provision.'},\n",

Health financing arrangements offer opportunities for governments to incentivize and reward improvements in the quality of care provided. This study examines the extent to which the purchasing arrangements established within Zambia’s new National Health Insurance can improve equitable access to high-quality care. We adopt the Strategic Purchasing Progress and the Lancet Commission for High-Quality Health Systems frameworks to critically examine the broader health system and the purchasing dimensions of this insurance scheme and its implications for quality care. We reviewed policy documents and conducted 31 key-informant interviews with stakeholders at national, subnational and health facility levels. We find that the new health insurance could boost financial resources in higher levels of care, improve access to high-cost interventions, improve care experiences for its beneficiaries and integrate the public and private sectors. Our findings also suggest that health insurance will likely improve some aspects of structural quality but may not be able to influence process and outcome measures of quality. It is also not clear if health insurance will improve the efficiency of service delivery and whether the benefits realized will be distributed equitably. These potential limitations are attributable to the existing governance and financial challenges, low investments in primary care and shortcomings in the design and implementation of the purchasing arrangements of health insurance. Although Zambia has made progress in a short span, there is a need to improve its provider payment mechanisms, and monitoring and accounting for a higher quality of care.'},\n",

The aim of this review was to identify how quality of mHealth interventions for cancer survivors is described and measured. METHODS CINAHL, EmCare, JBI, Medline, SCOPUS, and ProQuest databases from January 2008 to January 2020 were searched. Review papers with search terms related to mobile devices, quality, and cancer relevant to adults with cancer were included. Interventions needed to consist of mHealth technologies, such as mobile applications or short message service, or wearable devices. Title and abstract screening, full-text screening, and data extraction were performed independently by two reviewers. Conflicts were resolved by a third reviewer. Reviews were evaluated for coverage of quality according to six metrics defined by the Institute of Medicine: patient-centeredness, equitability, safety, effectiveness, timeliness, and efficiency. Any additional quality items were recorded. A Measurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) was used to rate the quality of the reviews included. RESULTS The initial search yielded 766 papers with seven systematic reviews meeting the eligibility criteria. Four papers were of AMSTAR moderate quality, with three of low quality. The median number of quality metrics reported in a review was two (the range was 1-4). Efficacy and safety and timeliness and efficiency were most reported (n = 4), followed by usability (n = 3), equitability and access (n = 2), privacy and security (n = 2), and patient-centeredness (n = 2). CONCLUSION There is great variability in how quality of mHealth interventions is defined with no reviews addressing all quality metrics.

       "  'abstract': 'Mobile-health (m-health) is described as the application of medical sensors and mobile computing to the healthcare provision. While 5G networks can support a variety of m-health services, applications such as telesurgery, holographic communications, and augmented/virtual reality are already emphasizing their limitations. These limitations apply to both the Quality of Service (QoS) and the Quality of Experience (QoE). However, 6G mobile networks are predicted to proliferate over the next decade in order to solve these limitations, enabling high QoS and QoE. Currently, academia and industry are concentrating their efforts on the 6G network, which is expected to be the next major game-changer in the telecom industry and will significantly impact all other related verticals. The exponential growth of m-health multimedia traffic (e.g., audio, video, and images) creates additional challenges for service providers in delivering a suitable QoE to their customers. As QoS is insufficient to represent the expectations of m-health end-users, the QoE of the services is critical. In recent years, QoE has attracted considerable attention and has established itself as a critical component of network service and operation evaluation. This article aims to provide the first thorough survey on a promising research subject that exists at the intersection of two well-established domains, i.e., QoE and m-health, and is driven by the continuing efforts to define 6G. This survey, in particular, creates a link between these two seemingly distinct domains by identifying and discussing the role of 6G in m-health applications from a QoE viewpoint. We start by exploring the vital role of QoE in m-health multimedia transmission. Moreover, we examine how m-health and QoE have evolved over the cellular network’s generations and then shed light on several critical 6G technologies that are projected to enable future m-health services and improve QoE, including reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, extended radio communications, terahertz communications, enormous ultra-reliable and low-latency communications, and blockchain. In contrast to earlier survey papers on the subject, we present an in-depth assessment of the functions of 6G in a variety of anticipated m-health applications via QoE. Multiple 6G-enabled m-health multimedia applications are reviewed, and various use cases are illustrated to demonstrate how 6G-enabled m-health applications are transforming human life. Finally, we discuss some of the intriguing research challenges associated with burgeoning multimedia m-health applications.'},\n",

In this light, we aim to evaluate the development of primary health institutions between 2013, before the implementation of the hierarchical diagnosis and treatment system, and 2020 as well as people’s perception of the quality of primary healthcare services. Method: The national-level data (e.g., the numbers of primary health institutions, personnel, beds, visits, and hospitalizations) regarding primary health institutions were collected from the Health Statistics Yearbook, and the perceptions of the quality of primary healthcare services were collected by a web-based questionnaire survey using an internationally recognized assessment tool (i.e., PCAT-AE). In total, 10,850 persons were surveyed, and 10,419 participants were incorporated into the final analysis after removing invalid questionnaires. A descriptive statistical analysis (i.e., frequency and percentage) was used to analyze the national-level characteristics of primary health institutions and people’s perceptions of the quality of primary healthcare services. Moreover, a logistic regression model was used to analyze the factors influencing the perceptions of the quality of primary healthcare services. Results: From the macro perspective, the number of primary health institutions, beds, and personnel per 10 thousand residents slightly increased from 2013 to 2020, especially in the eastern and central areas. However, the average number of visits and the hospitalization rate in primary health institutions showed a decrease, especially in central and eastern areas. Among participants, 92.2% (9606/10,419) of them had previously sought healthcare services in primary health institutions, and most were seeking general outpatient services (57.06–63.45%), followed by medicine purchasing (16.49–21.51%), physical examinations (9.91–11.49%), preventive health services (5.11–6.48%), and hospitalization services (3.17–5.67%). The total perception scores on the quality of primary healthcare services reported by the participants were 26.19 and 27.00 for rural and urban areas, respectively, which accounted for 65.5% and 67.5% of the total score, respectively, and 26.62, 26.86, and 25.89 for the eastern, central, and western areas, respectively, with percentages of 66.6%, 67.2%, and 64.7%. The perception score on the quality among people contracted with a family doctor (29.83, 74.58%) was much higher than those who were not (25.25, 63.13%), and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Moreover, people who were female, married, had higher incomes, and were diagnosed with various diseases had better perceptions of the primary healthcare services compared to their counterparts (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Improvements were seen for primary health institutions, especially in terms of hardware resources such as beds and personnel. However, the service utilization in primary health institutions did not improve between 2013 and 2020. The perception score on the quality of primary healthcare was moderate to low in rural and urban as well as eastern, central, and western areas, but it was significantly higher among people contracted with a family doctor than those who were not. Therefore, it is important for policy makers to take or adjust measures focusing on quality improvement and increasing the service utilization in primary health institutions with good first contact, accessibility, continuity, comprehensiveness, and coordination, such as raising the enrollment rate of family doctors and promoting the provision of high-quality services.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Background Primary health care (PHC) serves as the gatekeeper of health system and PHC physicians take on significant obligations to provide health care services in the pursuit of Universal Health Coverage (UHC). PHC physicians' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) can have a strong impact on patients, physicians and the health care system. Lifestyle interventions are found to be effective to improve HRQoL. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between lifestyle behaviors and HRQoL among PHC physicians, so that lifestyle intervention can be tailored by policy makers for health promotion. Methods A survey covering 31 provinces and administrative regions in China was conducted in 2020 using a stratified sampling strategy. Data on sociodemographic characteristics lifestyle behaviors and HRQoL were collected by a self-administered questionnaire. HRQoL was measured through EuroQol-five dimension-five level (EQ-5D-5L) instrument. A Tobit regression model was performed to evaluate the association between sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle behaviors and HRQoL. Results Among 894 PHC physicians who completed the survey, Anxiety/Depression (AD) was the dimension with the most problems reported (18.1%). Regular daily routine (β = 0.025, 95%CI 0.004 to 0.045) and good sleep quality (β = 0.049, 95% CI = 0.029 to 0.069) were protective factors for HRQoL, while smoking (β = −0.027, 95% CI = −0.079 to −0.003) and frequency of eating breakfast (β = −0.041, 95%CI = −0.079 to −0.003) were negatively associated with HRQoL. Physical activity and alcohol drinking were not significantly associated with HRQoL. Conclusion These findings suggest that tailored interventions on daily routine, improving sleep quality, and tobacco control among PHC physicians may be effective strategies to improve their HRQoL.\"},\n",

       "  'abstract': \"‘By striving to constantly do better, what we do is we send a message about values’. When I heard those words, despite now forgetting who voiced them, I heard angels sing. What better description could there be for the community of health professional education scholars this journal exists to serve? The imperfect (or lack of) predictability that defines education as a complex adaptive system, combined with the ‘wicked’ nature of the problems with which we grapple, makes it such that perfection is likely unattainable. It is enough to engender cynicism, to make some give up, and to ensure others never even try. It is also, however, an opportunity to model the engagement with learning that we expect of our trainees as they grow into health professionals. We preach about lifelong learning, about the importance of growth mindset, about adaptive models of expertise, about never treating competence as something that can be achieved full stop. What do we actually display though when we set our education policies, do the exact same thing year in and year out and resist efforts to bring new ideas forward with a dismissive ‘we can't’? Feasibility must always be a consideration and large organisations with large stakes should not change for the sake of change. Nor should changes be made without first accumulating a reasonable degree of relevant evidence. There is always room, however, for each and every one of us to ‘strive to constantly do better’. Nothing guarantees that every such effort will realise ‘better’, but core messages we can send about the values we wish to promote for health professionals derive from the effort itself, a willingness to fail and the strength to adapt that this field has come to epitomise. We cannot even guarantee that everyone will have the same perspective regarding what ‘better’ looks like, let alone how to get there, but by staying engaged in the dialogue, we increase the likelihood that better argumentation and, hence, clearer pathways will emerge. It is that spirit of continuous quality improvement that serves as the inspiration behind this year's State of the Science issue in Medical Education. Spearheaded by Janet Grant, Danette McKinley and Jack Boulet, the papers address philosophical questions pertaining to how quality is defined as well as practical questions pertaining to what role regulation plays in quality improvement, how particular aspects of curriculum and competence might strive towards enhancement and what quality improvement looks like when considering issues of equity, diversity and inclusion. This, of course, is just a sampling of ways in which the overarching principle of quality improvement ‘sends a message about values’, none of which should be treated as the final word on the matters addressed; such a mentality, after all, would not exactly align with the notion of continuous quality improvement. Each paper, however, offers valuable reminders of the gains that can be made when we think in terms of how to collectively get better rather than how to justify the status quo. For that, I speak on behalf of the authors, guest editors and myself by thanking our reviewers for their role in improving the quality of these offerings and the field as a whole.\"},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Healthcare is the most pivotal domain of every nation. With the sudden upraise of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a major concern for the healthcare industry to provide quality medical services to the common people. Vulnerable healthcare conditions have proven to be fatal for the patients. Conspicuously, it has become indispensable to assess the quality of healthcare services provided by the hospitals. The current article focuses on analyzing healthcare service quality delivered by the hospitals and healthcare centers. Specifically, the presented framework utilizes Internet of Things (IoT) technology to acquire real-time ambient data inside smart hospitals. The quantification of the healthcare service is performed using the Probability of Health Grade (PoHG) to classify data segments using the probabilistic Bayesian belief model. Furthermore, the temporal data abstraction is performed for the numerical analysis of healthcare service quality in terms of the health quality index (HQI). Finally, a 2-player game theory-inspired decision modeling is performed to analyze healthcare quality in a time-sensitive manner. The proposed framework is assessed using a simulated environment where 225325 data segments are analyzed. Results are compared with state-of-the-art techniques in which enhanced performance measures are registered in terms of classification efficacy (93.74%), decision-making efficiency [coefficient of determination (95%), accuracy (97.53%), mean square error (2.01%), and root mean square error (1.95%)], temporal delay (96.62 s), and reliability (91.58%).'},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Purpose Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important patient-related outcome for the assessment of interventions and treatments in older people. Understanding underlying mechanisms for HRQoL is crucial for improving care, rehabilitation and symptom relief. This study examined the associations between HRQoL and frailty, sarcopenia, dependence of ADL, physical function and nutritional status in older nursing home (NH) residents. Patients and Methods This is a cross-sectional study employing baseline data from the Older Person’s Exercise and Nutrition (OPEN) study. Residents ≥75 years and able to stand up from seated position, residing in eight nursing homes in Sweden, were recruited. The EuroQoL 5-dimension Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L, 0–1) was used to assess HRQoL. For exposure, the FRAIL and SARC-F questionnaires, Bergs Balance Scale, Functional Independence Measure (FIM), and Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF) were used, including chair-stand test, walking speed and some biochemical markers. Descriptive and inferential statistics including linear regression models were applied. Results Data from 113 residents (59% women, mean age 85 years) revealed a mean EQ-5D index of 0.76. After relevant adjustments, factors associated with low HRQoL were sarcopenia (p<0.001), cognitive function (p<0.001), dependence in ADL (p=0.002), low plasma-albumin (p=0.002) and impaired nutritional status (p=0.038). Conclusion This study displays evidence that modifiable conditions like sarcopenia and malnutrition are related to HRQoL in older NH residents. Such findings indicate a potential for physical exercise, including muscle training, and improved nutritional routines, including protein supplementation, to enhance nursing home care. Future studies, in larger NH populations, on exercise and nutrition for effects on HRQoL are needed.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'There is no single agreed definition of quality in healthcare, in part because of the huge range of settings within which care is delivered. However, there is agreement that quality care can be characterized by several different but interrelated concepts. In 2001, the Institute of Medicine defined six dimensions of healthcare quality: safety, effectiveness and appropriateness, patientcenteredness, timeliness and accessibility, efficiency, and equitability. These domains continue to underpin international definitions, interpretations, and frameworks, including the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Healthcare’s three pillars of healthcare quality: patient centeredness, care that is driven by information, and care that is organized by safety. The National Quality Board in the U.K. has updated its “Shared Commitment to Quality” document in 2021, emphasizing the domains of safety, effectiveness, patient centeredness, and equitability as key pillars of its framework, but adding leadership and financial sustainability of service delivery to these pillars. New emphasis on digitally-enabled care, strategies to reduce the workload of emergency departments, and grow systems that support greater out-ofhospital care probably reflect at least, in part, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare delivery in the U.K. While we think we know what high-quality care looks and feels like in our daily work as healthcare professionals, this is actually highly contextual and more subjective than it appears, and may be viewed very differently by the community, patients and families, funders, health departments, and politicians. The practices of radiology and radiation oncology are the crossroads of multiple disciplines in healthcare, and radiology, in particular, spans the community– specialist care divide.

Although health literacy has been linked to health-related quality of life, the pathway by which some factors mediate this relationship has not been well examined among Saudi women with chronic disease. Purpose This study was designed to examine the relationship between health literacy and health-related quality of life and determine the mediating roles of healthy lifestyle and patient-centered care in explaining this relationship. Methods A cross-sectional study was used. A random sample of 20 primary healthcare centers in Saudi Arabia was selected. A convenience sample of 300 women diagnosed with a chronic illness was recruited from these centers. Structural equation modeling was used to test the proposed relationships. Results Controlling for women's age and education, the hypothesized model adequately fit the data. Health literacy and its dimensions were found to positively and directly affect both patient-centered care (β = 0.614, B = 0.189, p < .001) and healthy lifestyle behaviors (β = 0.550, B = 1.211, p < .001). Furthermore, both patient-centered care (β = 0.390, B = 1.301, p < .001) and healthy lifestyle behaviors (β = 0.322, B = 0.150, p < .001) were found to positively and directly affect health-related quality of life, whereas health literacy had significant, direct (β = 0.285, B = 0.292, p < .001) and indirect (β = 0.417, B = 0.428, p < .001) effects on health-related quality of life through patient-centered care and healthy lifestyle behaviors. Conclusions/Implications for Practice Special consideration should be given to health literacy, patient-centered care, and healthy lifestyle behaviors to enhance health-related quality of life in women with chronic illness. Gender-specific health services and interventions are needed to improve women's health literacy.\"},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Employment quality (EQ) has gained increasing attention as a determinant of health, but the debate among occupational health researchers over the measurement of EQ poses a challenge to advancing the literature. This is especially problematic when the concept is used across social, cultural, and national borders, as EQ is shaped by power dynamics within sociopolitical and economic contexts that are specific to each society. Investigating EQ in context could help develop a clearer understanding as to why EQ is configured in certain ways, how best EQ could be measured, how EQ impacts health, and ultimately how EQ could be improved. In this paper, we propose that attention to social context—and in particular power—may help advance the research on EQ and health. We present an allegory, or a visual description, that articulates the power balance in the employer–worker relation as well as in the sociopolitical context in which the employer–worker relation takes place. We end by proposing specific approaches for occupational health researchers to incorporate a perspective of power in EQ research that may clarify the concept and measurement of EQ. A clearer recognition of EQ as a product of power in social context aligns with the research approach of addressing work as a social structural determinant of health.'},\n",

We found that Black and Hispanic home health patients had a 2.2-percentage-point and a 2.5-percentage-point lower adjusted probability of high-quality agency use, respectively, compared with their White counterparts within the same neighborhoods. Low-income patients had a 1.2-percentage-point lower adjusted probability of high-quality agency use compared with their higher-income counterparts, whereas home health patients residing in neighborhoods with higher proportions of marginalized residents had a lower adjusted probability of high-quality agency use. Some 40–77 percent of the disparities in high-quality agency use were attributable to neighborhood-level factors.
